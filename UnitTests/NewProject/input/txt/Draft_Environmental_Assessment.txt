<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
1.1 INTRODUCTION<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Heavy rains in December 2007 caused severe landslides, mudslides, and flooding in western <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Washington. The rains caused slope failures (landslides) at two nearby sites in the Potosi Creek <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
drainage in the Capitol State Forest (or Capitol Forest) in Thurston County, Washington. The <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
landslides destroyed portions of the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) C-4500 Road and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
parallel sections (totaling approximately 400 linear feet) of the Mount Molly Loop Trail and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
another unnamed motorized recreation trail located near and downhill of the road (see Figure <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
1.1-1, Project Location). The photo below shows the slope failure at one of the sites along the C-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
4500 Road that destroyed a 350-foot long section of motorized recreation trail downhill of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
road.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The president declared the storm event a major disaster (FEMA 1734-DR-WA), making federal <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
funding available for emergency work and repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
DNR has decided not to rebuild the C-4500 Road at the two landslide areas due to the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
extremely high cost of repair. Rebuilding the forest road at the two damaged sites would require <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
stabilizing steep slopes (50 percent and greater) (pers. comm., Wolff and Shedd, 2011), blasting a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
bench in solid rock, and placing large quantities of fill material for the road bed. The cost to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
restore the C-4500 Road to pre-disaster conditions has been estimated at $3.3 million at one site <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and $9,600 at the other site (FEMA 2010). Rebuilding the trails without rebuilding the road <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
would still require much of the same slope stabilization, rock blasting, and fill placement. As <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
DNR has decided not to rebuild the C-4500 Road, the damaged sections of motorized recreation <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
trail cannot reasonably be rebuilt in their original locations. Therefore, DNR has applied through <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the Washington State Emergency Management Division (EMD) to the Federal Emergency <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Management Agency (FEMA) for funding of an alternate project. The alternate project would <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
combine and reroute the damaged sections of the motorized recreation trail to bypass above the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
landslide areas. The alternate project does not include rebuilding or rerouting the damaged C-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
4500 Road. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This Draft Environmental Assessment (EA) has been prepared to help FEMA meet its <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
environmental review responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
1969, the Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ’s) implementing regulations (40 Code of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Federal Regulations [CFR] Parts 1500 through 1508), and FEMA’s implementing regulations (40 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
CFR Part 10). FEMA is also using the EA to document compliance with other applicable federal <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
laws and executive orders, including the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Magnuson-Stevens <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), the National Historic Preservation Act <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(NHPA), Executive Order (EO) 11988 (Floodplains), EO 11990 (Wetlands), and EO 12898 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(Environmental Justice).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
FEMA will use the findings in and public comments on this Draft EA to determine whether to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). If the action is determined not to significantly <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
affect the quality of the human and natural environments, then FEMA will make a Finding of No <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Significant Impact (FONSI), and preparation of an EIS will not be warranted. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This document describes the purpose and need for the Proposed Action, the project alternatives, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the affected environment and potential impacts on that environment resulting from the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
alternatives, cumulative effects, public involvement, and resources consulted.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
1.2 BACKGROUND AND LOCATION<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The project is located near Larch Mountain in the northern half of the Capitol Forest, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
approximately 10 miles southwest of Olympia in Thurston County, Washington (see Figure 1.1-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
1). The Capitol Forest is a 91,650-acre “working forest” located southwest of Olympia in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Thurston and Grays Harbor counties. The forest is managed by the DNR Pacific Cascade Region <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
for timber production, wildlife habitat, and recreation and public access. The Capitol Forest has <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
been open to the public since 1955 and draws an estimated 800,000 visitors each year for hiking, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
horseback riding, camping, mountain biking, off-road vehicle (ORV) use, hunting, nature study, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
sightseeing, and more. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The Capitol Forest is divided into to two parts to prevent conflicts between motorized and non-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
motorized recreation. Motorized recreation, such as ORV use, is allowed in the northern half of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the forest, and horseback riding is limited to the south. Mountain bikers and hikers use both <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
halves of the forest, with some trails limited to hikers only. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The Mount Molly Loop Trail is a 7.7-mile long motorized trail open to all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
motorbikes, mountain bikes, and hikers. The other unnamed trail damaged by the landslide is a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
motorized trail open for the same uses. DNR closed the damaged sections of both trails to all <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
recreation use following the 2007 landslides due to the unsafe conditions (pers. comm., Wolff. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and Shedd, 2011). Both the damaged trail sections and the proposed trail reroute are located <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
within Township 18 North, Range 4 West, Section 36 and Township 17 North, Range 4 West, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Section 1. The coordinates of the damaged trail sections are: (Site 1) N 46.997 (latitude) / W-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
123.123 (longitude), and (Site 2) N 46.995 / W-123.125. The proposed trail reroute is <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
approximately 1 mile long. The beginning and ending coordinates of the trail reroute are: (north <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
end) N 46.998 / W -123.119 and (south end) N 46.993 / W-123.125 (see Figure 1.1-1, Project <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Location).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The parallel sections of motorized recreation trail that were destroyed in the December 2007 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
landslides were located near and downhill from the C-4500 Road. The proposed alignment for <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the rerouted trail would bypass above the landslide area. The rerouted trail would begin at the C-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
4000 Road and would follow the ridge slightly north of the C-4000 Road for a portion of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
route, then cross over the road and drop down the hill to connect with an intact section of the C-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
4500 Road beyond the landslide area. The trail would follow the road for approximately 25 feet, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
then reconnect to the intact portion of the Mount Molly Loop Trail beyond the landslide area (see <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Figure 1.1-1, Project Location).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
1.3 PURPOSE AND NEED<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The purpose of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1973 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(Stafford Act), as amended, is to provide a range of federal assistance to state and local <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
governments to supplement efforts and resources in alleviating damage or loss from major <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
disasters and/or emergencies. The objective of the FEMA Public Assistance (PA) Grant Program <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
is to provide assistance to state, tribal, and local governments, and certain types of Private Non-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Profit (PNP) organizations so that communities can quickly respond to and recover from major <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
disasters or emergencies declared by the president. Through the PA Grant Program, FEMA <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
provides supplemental federal disaster grant assistance for debris removal, emergency protective <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
measures, and the repair, replacement, restoration, or relocation of disaster-damaged, publicly <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
owned facilities and the facilities of certain PNP organizations. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The need for the FEMA action is to provide funds to DNR to restore the trail function that was <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
lost in the December 2007 landslides. The damaged trail sections provided through-access along <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the motorized trail network and off of the forest roads in the Larch Mountain area.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
To meet the project need, DNR identified the following objectives: <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Reduce safety hazards arising from: (1) conflicts between recreationists and timber <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
harvest activities by providing a trail for ATV, motorbike, mountain bike, and hiking use <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
as an alternative to using the C-4000 Road; and (2) higher ORV speeds associated with <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
traveling on roads rather than ORV trails, which are designed to reduce ORV speeds.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Restore through-access along the motorized trail network in a geologically stable area to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
reduce the risk of future trail damage from landslides.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Minimize ground disturbance, stream and wetland crossings, and tree removal.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Minimize costs.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
1.4 RELATED ACTIONS<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
As stated previously, the December 2007 storms damaged multiple facilities at various sites on <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
forest land owned by the DNR. DNR has requested FEMA funding to repair some of these <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
damaged sites and to fund other alternate projects such as removing or replacing culverts that <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
block fish passage. Although these projects are related under the same disaster (FEMA 1734-DR-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
WA), they are being addressed under separate NEPA processes from the Mount Molly Loop <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Trail Reroute. DNR has no plans in the foreseeable future to repair the C-4500 Road. According <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
to DNR, the timber harvest and other natural resources previously accessed via the C-4500 Road <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
can be accessed via other routes. There are no known actions related to the Proposed Action <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
evaluated in this EA.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
1.5 RESOURCE TOPICS NOT ADDRESSED IN DETAIL IN THE EA<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The CEQ and FEMA regulations (44 CFR Section 10) that implement NEPA require NEPA <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
documents to be concise, focus on the issues relevant to the project, and exclude extraneous <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
background data and discussion of subjects that are not relevant or would not be affected by the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
project alternatives. Accordingly, the following subjects are not evaluated in detail for the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
following reasons:<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Land Use and Socioeconomics<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The project alternatives would not affect land use or socioeconomic <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
conditions in the project vicinity.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Transportation and Access<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The project alternatives would not affect transportation and vehicle <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
access in the project vicinity. Trail access is addressed under Recreation.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Air Quality<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The project is located in a rural area with a low population density and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
low traffic volumes. Construction would create a limited amount of dust <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and minor vehicle emissions from vehicles bringing in materials; <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
however, impacts would be temporary and minor. Air quality impacts are <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
not expected to increase above current levels. No long-term reduction in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
air quality is expected once construction activities are completed.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Noise<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The project is located in a motorized recreation area; it is not anticipated <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
to change the existing noise environment. Noise-related impacts are <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
addressed as appropriate in Section 3.4, Fish and Wildlife.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>

<paragraph></paragraph>
and other site features]<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
2.0 Alternatives, Including the Proposed Action<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The CEQ regulations require federal agencies to consider a reasonable range of alternatives that <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
meet the purpose and need of a proposed action in their NEPA review. Reasonable alternatives <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
are alternative ways of meeting a project need, but with varying degrees of environmental <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
impact. Alternatives that would clearly result in substantially greater environmental impact than <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the Proposed Action do not require detailed analysis. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The following sections describe the alternatives being considered for the Mount Molly Loop Trail <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Reroute Project, and the process used to develop these alternatives. Although the December <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
2007 landslides in the Capitol State Forest also destroyed portions of the DNR C-4500 Road, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the Proposed Action evaluated in this EA does not include rebuilding or rerouting the road. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
DNR has no plans in the foreseeable future to restore the access lost from the December 2007 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
landslide damage to the C-4500 Road. The timber harvest and other natural resources previously <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
accessed via the C-4500 Road can be accessed via other routes.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This EA analyzes two alternatives for the project: Alternative A (No Action Alternative) and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative B (Proposed Action). It also describes alternatives that were considered but not <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
carried forward for further analysis. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
2.1 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT NOT CARRIED FORWARD<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Rebuild the Damaged Sections of the Motorized Recreation Trails near the C-4500 Road in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
their Original Locations<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
As described in Section 1.1 (Introduction), DNR considered rebuilding the damaged C-4500 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Road and damaged sections of motorized recreation trail to pre-disaster conditions in their <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
original locations. However, this would require stabilizing the failed slope at both sites, blasting <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
in solid rock to create a bench to perch fill on, and placing large quantities of fill to rebuild the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
road bed and trails. The cost to accomplish this is extremely high (estimated at $3.3 million for <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
one site and $9,600 for the other site) in comparison to the Proposed Action, which is limited to a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
trail project to bypass the landslide area (estimated at $22,722 – $26,722). Given the steep slopes <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(50 percent and greater), bedrock, and shallow, exposed soils at the two damaged sites, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
rebuilding the C-4500 Road and damaged trail sections in the same locations would also have <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
considerably greater impacts on geology, soils, and slope stability than the Proposed Action. For <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
these reasons, rebuilding the motorized trail sections in their original locations was eliminated <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
from further consideration.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
2.2 ALTERNATIVE A – NO ACTION<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the No Action Alternative, FEMA would not provide funding to DNR to reroute the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Mount Molly Loop Trail to bypass the landslide areas. The damaged trail sections would remain <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
unusable and closed to recreational use permanently. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
DNR could choose to move forward with rerouting the trail without FEMA funding. However, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the potential for this to occur is entirely speculative; therefore, the No Action Alternative <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
assumes that the damaged trail sections would remain in their current condition indefinitely for <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the purposes of analysis in this EA.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
2.3 ALTERNATIVE B – PROPOSED ACTION<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the Proposed Action, FEMA would provide funding to DNR to construct a section of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
motorized recreation trail to bypass above the 2007 landslide area and the damaged C-4500 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Road and trail sections. The Proposed Action includes the construction of approximately 1 mile <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
of new motorized recreation trail, including one bridge, and the abandonment and rehabilitation <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
of approximately 0.5 mile of trail not damaged in the landslide that would be bypassed by the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
new route (see Figure 1.1-1, Project Location). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The estimated cost to build the trail is $17,722.00 (FEMA 2010). The trail bridge is estimated to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
cost an additional $5,000 to $9,000 including engineering and materials (pers. comm., Wolff and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Shedd, 2011). The estimate includes design, bridge engineering and fabrication, materials, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
labor costs for the proposed project. General construction activities and best management <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
practices (BMPs) identified as part of the project are described in detail below.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The project would include the following construction activities:<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Mobilizing equipment and staging materials. Construction equipment would include <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
motorized/mechanical equipment and hand tools, including pick-up trucks for crew <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
transport (three pick-ups trips per day at 2 hrs/day), three ATVs with trailer units to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
transport surfacing rock, a “trail machine” that is equivalent to a wheel loader-backhoe to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
load the rock into the ATV trailers, mini-excavators, chain saws, weed-eaters, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
shovels. All equipment and materials would be staged (temporarily stored) within <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
already-disturbed areas, such as wide areas along the C-4000 Road.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Clearing, brushing, and grubbing. Vegetation clearing would involve the removal of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
shrubs and herbaceous vegetation to a 4-foot wide alignment along the trail length. The <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
exact trail alignment would be determined in the field to avoid trees to the extent <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
possible. It may be necessary to remove a few small trees (up to 5-inches diameter at <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
breast height [dbh] maximum). Surface soil would be removed down to mineral soils <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
along the 4-foot wide alignment for the length of the trail. Vegetation would be brushed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(cut back) beyond the traveled surface width to 6 feet wide and 8 feet high along the trail <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
length. Vegetation and soil removed for the project would be scattered onto the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
surrounding landscape.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Constructing the trail. As described above, the trail would have a 4-foot wide travel <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
surface and be brushed beyond the travel surface width to 6 feet wide and 8 feet high <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
along the trail length. Trail construction would primarily be accomplished using a mini-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
excavator with some work done by hand. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Hardening the trail. Sections of the trail where the surface is soft and/or wet, primarily <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
on both sides of the stream crossing (including the bridge approaches), would be <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
hardened to reduce erosion. This would be accomplished by placing and compacting 2 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
inches of crushed rock up to 1½ inches in size in these areas. It is estimated that <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
approximately 130 cubic yards of crushed rock would be required. The crushed rock <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
would be purchased from a commercial source and transported from the C-4000 Road to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
sites as needed using ATV trailer units. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Installing/constructing drainage control structures. The trail would be constructed to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
avoid continuous grades so that water will periodically flow from the trail, rather than <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
along it. Water diversions, such as grade reversals and drain dips, would be constructed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
where necessary. Drain dips are shallow depressions in the trail surface typically filled <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
with crushed rock that direct small amounts of surface water across the trail and avoid the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
collection of water on the uphill side of the trail. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Constructing/installing the bridge. A 5- to 6-foot wide by 25- to 30-foot long steel I-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
beam bridge with railings would be constructed to support the new trail section across the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
seasonal stream along the new motorized trail alignment. DNR would determine the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
ordinary high water (OHW) of the stream (if one exists) and the boundaries of any <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
associated wetlands that are identified during its wetland investigation. The bridge <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
clearance above the stream is anticipated to be approximately 5–6 feet, but no less than at <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
least 4 ½ feet. The bridge abutments/approaches would be located outside of the stream <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
OHW and any associated wetlands that are identified. Depending on site conditions, the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
goal is to approach the bridge at a slightly uphill grade to ensure no sediment enters the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
stream from the trail. The bridge approaches would be constructed with modern pressure-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
treated wood and wrapped in geo-textile fabric to minimize erosion. If the grade of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
bridge approaches is between 6 and 10 percent, a combination of concrete building blocks <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and crushed rock would be used. If the grade of the bridge approaches is less than 6 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
percent, only crushed rock would be used.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Abandoning and rehabilitating the trail alignment. Approximately 0.5 mile of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
original Mount Molly Loop Trail that was not destroyed in the 2007 landslides and that <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
would be bypassed by the new route would be abandoned and rehabilitated. This would <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
involve removing any built structures, loosening the trail surface soils with a mini-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
excavator, softening the slope of the abandoned trail to blend into the surrounding <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
landscape, and planting native vegetation, such as salal (Gaultheria shallon) and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
swordfern (Polystichum munitum). Woody debris would be pulled across the abandoned <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
trail at the access points and along the trail to block access and discourage unauthorized <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
use. The damaged sections of trail covered or destroyed by the landslides would not be <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
rehabilitated. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Construction of the project is anticipated to take approximately 2–3 months using a 4-person <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
crew with an additional crew member present to load surfacing rock for transport by ATV/trailer <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
units. The project would be constructed by DNR staff, or a combination of DNR staff and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Washington Conservation Corps (WCC) crew or Department of Corrections (DOC) labor under <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
close supervision. Project construction would be scheduled to avoid wet soil conditions, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
would probably occur during the late spring, summer, or early fall.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
DNR would adhere to federal, state, and county regulations, permit conditions, and BMPs for <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the design, construction, and long-term maintenance of the proposed project, including, but not <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
limited to: <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Trail Design and Construction: Trail design and construction would be in accordance <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
with the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) ORV trail standards (USFS 1991). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Stream and Wetland Protection: The project alignment crosses a small (less than 2-foot) <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
wide), seasonal, non-fish bearing stream (described in detail in Section 3.2, Hydrology, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Water Quality, Floodplains, and Wetlands). Vegetation observed within and around the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
stream during a September 2010 site visit included three species that are known to occur <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
both in wetlands and in uplands (in moist to wet, shady forest conditions) (described in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
detail in Section 3.3, Vegetation). One obligate wetland sedge species was also observed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
in or near the stream by a FEMA Wetland Scientist during the site visit. However, a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
complete wetland investigation, which would include a comprehensive field investigation <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
of vegetation, soils, and hydrologic conditions to determine whether conditions at the site <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
meet wetland definition criteria, was not conducted as part of the September 2010 site <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
visit. Given the presence of some wetland associated plants in the stream vicinity, it is <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
possible that wetland conditions occur as a wetland fringe along the stream channel in the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
vicinity of the project alignment. DNR will conduct a wetland investigation in the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
vicinity of the project alignment crossing through the stream drainage to determine <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
whether wetlands are present and, if so, to determine the wetland boundary.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Installing Temporary Erosion Control: Silt fencing would be installed around the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
stream and associated wetlands (if present) in the vicinity of the project alignment prior to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
construction of the bridge approaches and bridge and before any ground-disturbing <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
activities are conducted in the area. Straw would be placed over disturbed and exposed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
soils around the stream and any associated wetlands after construction to minimize <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
potential erosion and sedimentation until soils are stabilized.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Vegetation Clearing and Grubbing: These specifications direct clearing operations, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
including removing, preserving, and trimming trees and other vegetation. They also <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
address grubbing operations (i.e., removing roots) and limit the area of approved actions. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
These specifications protect vegetation both inside and outside approved work areas. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Vegetation clearing and ground disturbance for the proposed project would be limited to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
that essential for the project and would be in accordance with the USFS ORV trail <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
standards (USFS 1991). Vegetation would be cleared to 4 feet wide for the trail travel <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
surface and brushed beyond the trail to 6 feet wide and 8 feet high. Trail alignment <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
would be field determined to avoid trees to the extent possible. Any trees removed for <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the project would be no larger than 5 inches dbh.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Water Quality, Erosion, and Sediment Control: These specifications require the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
implementation of a Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control (TESC) Plan to comply <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
with federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Erosion and sediment control <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
specifications typically focus on soil and slope protection and stabilization measures, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
followed by site restoration methods (including planting materials). TESC BMPs for the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
proposed trail project would involve installing silt fencing on both sides of the trail in the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
vicinity of the stream crossing prior to the start of ground disturbance in that area and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
prior to construction of the bridge approaches and bridge structure. Straw mulch would <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
be place over disturbed and exposed soils around the stream after construction until soils <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
are stabilized.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Environmental Protection: These specifications require compliance with laws and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
regulations designed to protect sensitive environmental resources. To ensure that all <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
construction-related pollutants are controlled and contained, a project-specific Spill <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan would be developed and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
implemented. These specifications addresses hazardous waste and hazardous substances <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
management, pollution control, protection of plant and animal species, protection of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
wetlands, and protection of cultural resources, as well as other applicable safety, health, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and human resource issues.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>

2.4 SUMMARY OF EFFECTS<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Table 2.4-1 summarizes the effects described and analyzed in Chapter 3 (Affected Environment <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and Environmental Consequences). Levels of potential effect are defined as follows:<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*None/Negligible: The resource area would not be affected, or changes would be non-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
detectable or, if detected, effects would be slight and local. Impacts would be well below <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
regulatory limits.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Minor: Changes to the resource would be measurable, although the changes would be <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
small and localized. Impacts would be within or below regulatory limits. Mitigation <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
measures may be necessary to reduce potential effects.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Moderate: Changes to the resource would be measurable and have localized and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
potentially regional scale impacts. Impacts would be within or below regulatory limits, but <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
historical conditions would be altered. Mitigation measures may be necessary to reduce <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
potential effects.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Major: Changes would be readily measurable and would have substantial consequences <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
on a local and/or regional level. Impacts would exceed regulatory limits. Mitigation <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
measures to offset the effects would be required to reduce impacts, although long-term <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
changes to the resource would be possible.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The criteria and thresholds of significance used in the analysis are defined by resource in <paragraph></paragraph>

3.0 Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The following sections describe the affected environment (including regulatory considerations) <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and environmental consequences of the Proposed Action on physical, biological, recreational, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
visual, and cultural resources in the project area. The level of detail for each resource topic is <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
commensurate with the scale and context of the proposed project and the potential impacts of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
project alternatives on that resource. As described in Chapter 1, certain resource topics are not <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
evaluated in detail because the project alternatives would have no effect on those resources or <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
effects are known and minimal. These include land use, socioeconomics, transportation, and air <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
quality. Access in the context of the proposed project is related to recreation and is addressed in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Section 3.5, Recreation and Visual Resources. Noise within the context of the proposed project is <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
addressed in Section 3.4, Fish and Wildlife.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.1 GEOLOGY, SOILS, AND SLOPE STABILITY<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This section describes the existing condition of the physical landscape in the project vicinity, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
including geology, soils, and slope stability, with additional information on topography and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
landforms as applicable, and describes the potential effects of the project alternatives on these <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
resources.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.1.1 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The project is located near Larch Mountain in the Capitol Forest (see Figure 1.1-1, Project <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Location). The Capitol Forest is located in part of a low-lying mountain range along the western <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
boundary of Thurston County known as the Black Hills (DNR 2005). The Black Hills are within <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the Willapa Hills physiogeographic province and are part of the Coast Range (Lasmanis 1991). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Mountains in the Black Hills are mainly rounded peaks and ridges of basalt (SCS 1990). They <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
include Capitol Peak, Fuzzy Top, Rock Candy, and Larch Mountain. The elevation of the Capitol <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Forest ranges from 200 feet along the Chehalis River up to its highest point atop Larch Mountain <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
at 2,660 feet (DNR 2005).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The proposed project alignment traverses a ridge running approximately north-south between <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Larch Mountain and Rock Candy Mountain for approximately 0.46 mile, and then switches back <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
down the east face of the slope within the Potosi Creek drainage for approximately 0.41 mile (see <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Figure 1.1-1, Project Location). The ridge between Larch Mountain and Rock Candy Mountain <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
separates the Waddell Creek drainage (to the east) from the North Fork Porter Creek drainage (to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the west). The Potosi Creek drainage is one of several small and steep headwater drainages on <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
this east-facing slope that form Waddell Creek. Along the ridge, the proposed project alignment <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
begins at an elevation of approximately 1,710 feet (above mean sea level), and rises to a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
maximum elevation of approximately 2,010 feet. The proposed project alignment then drops <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
down the eastern face of the slope within the Potosi Creek drainage to approximately 1,790 feet <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
in elevation where it intersects the remaining portion of the C-4500 Road. The damaged trail <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
sections are located along the C-4500 Road to the east, on steep slopes (greater than 50 percent) <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
in the Potosi Creek drainage, and at elevations of approximately 1,700 and 1,800 feet. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
While clay-based soils are inherent throughout much of the Capitol State Forest (DNR 2005), <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
soils in the project area are mapped as Katula very cobbly loam (NRCS 2009). These soil types <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
are found on narrow ridgetops and back slopes in upland areas in the project vicinity. Depth to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
lithic bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches (NRCS 2009; SCS 1990). Both of these soils types are <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
considered to be well drained (NRCS 2009). Permeability is moderate in the Katula soil (SCS <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
1990). On 20–30 percent slopes, runoff is slow and water erosion hazard is slight on Katula soils <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(SCS 1990). On 30–65 percent slopes, runoff and water erosion hazard are medium (SCS 1990).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Debris slides, avalanches, and debris flows occurred in the Potosi Creek drainage as a result of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the December 3, 2007 storm event, including the slope failures that damaged the motorized trail <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
sections to be replaced by this project (see Figure 3.1-1, Recent Landslides in the Potosi Creek <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Drainage). The December 3, 2007 debris slides and avalanches originated high in the watershed, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
between approximately 1,700 and 1,800 feet in elevation, on steep (40–50 percent) slopes in the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
upper reaches of small, seasonal streams that drain the slope and flow into Potosi Creek. Debris <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
flows occurred lower in the drainage along both stream channels and along the entire length of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Potosi Creek up to its confluence with Waddell Creek (DNR 2010a).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.1.1.1 Regulatory Context<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
No specific regulations or requirements directly target geology, soils, or slope stability within the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Capitol Forest.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.1.2 METHODOLOGY AND THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The potential effects of the project alternatives on geology, soils, and slope stability were <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
evaluated in terms of ecological context and intensity. AECOM ecologists gathered and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
reviewed available information regarding geologic hazards and soils in the project vicinity <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(primarily within the Potosi Creek drainage area), and conducted a site visit on September 29, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
2010 to collect information on general site conditions along the proposed project alignment. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Direct impacts on soil resources were quantified, while the potential indirect impacts of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
project alternatives were qualitatively identified based on best professional judgment.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Based on the location of the proposed project alignment along a ridgetop and steep side slope <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
with seasonal stream drainages, past landslide activity, and recreational uses, a project alternative <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
was determined to result in a significant effect on geology, soils, or slope stability if it would:<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Present a substantial risk to people or property due to geologic hazards such as landslides.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Cause substantial long-term erosion of soils.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Result in a substantial accumulation of sediment in downstream aquatic habitats.<paragraph></paragraph>

3.1.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This section describes the potential effects of the project alternatives on geology, soils, and slope <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
stability in the project area. Measures to avoid, reduce, or mitigate for any identified impacts on <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
recreational and visual resources are also identified.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative A (No Action)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the No Action Alternative, FEMA would not provide funds to support DNR in rerouting <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the Mount Molly Loop Trail to bypass above the December 2007 landslides that damaged <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
sections of two motorized recreation trails in that area. Without FEMA funding, DNR would not <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
construct the proposed trail reroute or rehabilitate the intact sections of trail leading to the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
landslide area. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the No Action Alternative, no ground-disturbing activities would occur along the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
proposed project alignment or the closed trails. Since the compacted surface soils on the closed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
trails would not be loosened and the slopes softened to blend into the surrounding landscape, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
some erosion potential would remain. However, understory shrubs that were previously brushed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
back from the trail travel way would grow back relatively quickly (within approximately 1–2 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
years) and would intercept some precipitation, reducing erosion potential in the near term. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Species, such as red alder (Alnus rubra), that successfully establish themselves in disturbed and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
compacted soils would also begin to grow within the trail travel way relatively quickly (within <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
approximately 1–5 years), further reducing erosion potential as they mature and intercept more <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
precipitation. Over time, forest litter (leaves, needles, twigs, etc.) would accumulate, and along <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
with natural forest soils processes, would encourage the growth of other vegetation, eventually <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
reducing erosion potential on the closed trail to levels similar to adjacent areas. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The No Action Alternative would have no effect on local geology and would have a negligible <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
adverse effect on soils and slope stability.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative B (Proposed Action)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the Proposed Action Alternative, FEMA would provide funds to support DNR in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
rerouting the Mount Molly Mount Molly Loop Trail to bypass above the December 2007 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
landslides that damaged sections of two motorized recreation trails in that area.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Roughly 0.5 acre of soil would be disturbed during construction of the proposed trail reroute. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Soil along the trail travel way would be permanently compacted and would be hardened in some <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
areas with crushed rock. Trail design and construction, erosion and sediment control BMPs <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
described in Section 2.3 (Alternative B – Proposed Action), and ongoing trail maintenance <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
practices would reduce soil erosion during construction and operation of the project to negligible <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
levels.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
DNR has completed a preliminary field determination of the proposed project alignment. The <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
trail reroute would follow the ridge line for approximately 0.46 mile where there is little to no risk <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
to slope stability. The trail reroute would then switch back down the east slope of the ridge, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
where it would follow relatively flat to low-gradient (0–5 percent) natural benches in the slope <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
along much of the route. The steepest gradients occur in the last quarter mile of the route, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
including switchbacks, where slopes are estimated to range between 10 and 30 percent. The <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
December 2007 landslides in the Potosi Creek drainage originate on steeper slopes (50 percent <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and greater) lower in the drainage. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The location of the proposed trail reroute on lower gradient slopes high up in the drainage, away <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
from all but the uppermost reach of one small undefined seasonal stream drainage, along with <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
adherence to USFS ORV trail design standards and drainage control structures, would have a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
negligible effect on slope stability and present a negligible risk to people or property from <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
landslides.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Permanent closure of the trail sections to be bypassed with the proposed project alignment, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
softening the slope to blend into the surrounding slope, and planting native vegetation (primarily <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
swordfern and salal) along the closed trail would reduce erosion potential in that area to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
negligible levels.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Overall, the Proposed Action would have a negligible adverse effect on soils and slope stability <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
in the Potosi Creek drainage.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Mitigation Measures<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The No Action and Proposed Action alternatives would have no effect on local geology and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
would have negligible adverse effects on soils and slope stability. The Proposed Action <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
incorporates avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures into the project design and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
implementation and would adhere to the BMPs listed in Section 2.3. No additional mitigation <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
measures are proposed for geology, soils, and slope stability.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Significant Unavoidable Adverse Effects<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The No Action and Proposed Action alternatives would have no significant effects on geology, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
soils, or slope stability.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.2 HYDROLOGY, WATER QUALITY, FLOODPLAINS, AND WETLANDS<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This section describes hydrology, water quality, floodplains, and wetlands in the project vicinity, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and the potential effects of the project alternatives on these resources. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.2.1 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Watershed Setting and Hydrology<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The project vicinity is located in the Upper Chehalis Water Resource Inventory Area (WRIA) 23, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
near a north-south ridgeline. The project area is in the Waddell Creek basin (6th field Hydrologic <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Unit Code [HUC] 171001030505) within the greater Black River watershed. Total annual <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
precipitation for the area is about 51 inches (SCS 1990) and is the major source of water, both <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
surface and subsurface flow, in the project vicinity. The Waddell Creek basin (11,380 acres) <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
includes several steep, relatively straight, headwater creeks including: Sunbeam Creek, Potosi <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Creek, Camp Four Creek, and Noski Creek. However, the damaged sites and proposed trail <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
alignment are near the top of the ridgeline, and only a small unnamed headwater tributary <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(project area tributary) to Potosi Creek is present along the proposed alignment (Figure 3.1-1). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Although the upper reach of Potosi Creek has an average gradient of 12 to 20 percent (WDFW <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
2011), the proposed location of the bridge over the project area tributary has a much lower <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
gradient, suitable for the proposed trail crossing. The narrow project area tributary has seasonal <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
flow; it was observed as dry during the summer by DNR, and had 2 inches of water in small step <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
pools during the site visit on September 29, 2010. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Forest Practices Application and Review System mapping indicates that the project area tributary <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
is a Type N water that does not meet the physical criteria to be potentially used by fish (DNR <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
2011). Type N (formerly type 4 or 5) waters make up approximately 90 percent of the stream <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
network on DNR-managed forest lands (DNR 1997c). These streams (including the project area <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
tributary) are major links between hillslopes and fish-bearing streams (DNR 1997c, Pitlick and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Wilcock 2001). These links enhance aquatic environments downstream by providing areas for <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
sorting sediment and delivering stream substrate (Pitlick and Wilcock 2001). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Water Quality<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Washington's Water Quality Assessment lists the status of water quality for a particular location <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
in one of five categories recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). Administered in Washington state by the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Department of Ecology (Ecology), the 303(d) list reports on Category 5 waters, which are <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
impaired waters of the state. Waters placed on the 303(d) list require the preparation of a plan to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
improve water quality by limiting pollutant loads. No waters in the project area are 303(d) listed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
as an impaired water of the state (Ecology 2008a). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Waddell Creek is one of the sites with the highest mean turbidity in the WRIA 23 and is <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
considered sediment rich (Green et al. 2009). Turbidity tends to be highest during the winter, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
particularly after storms and flood events, and lowest during the summer (Green et al. 2009). As <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
described in Section 3.1 (Geology, Soils, and Slope Stability), the damaged sites are actively <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
eroding and delivering more sediment to headwater stream channels that are already sediment <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
rich.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Floodplains<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The project is not located within a floodplain (FEMA 1982). FEMA regulations define a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
floodplain as “the lowland and relatively flat areas adjoining inland and coastal waters including, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
at a minimum, that area subject to a 1 percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year” <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(44 CFR 9.4). The project location is mapped on the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
for Thurston County, Washington (unincorporated areas) (Community Panel Numbers <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
5301880275C and 5301880250C) as “Zone C” (FEMA 1982). These are areas of minimal flood <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
hazard.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Wetlands<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Information was gathered from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) National Wetlands <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Inventory (NWI) maps (USFWS 2011a, WDFW 2010) and the DNR Forest Practices <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Application Review System (DNR 2011); these sources showed no wetlands in the project area. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The closest wetlands are mapped approximately 1.5 miles east of the project area near the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
confluence of Potosi Creek and Waddell Creek (Figure 3.1-1). As described in Section 3.1 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(Geology, Soils, and Slope Stability), clay-based soils are inherent throughout much of the Capitol <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Forest (DNR 2005); however, soils in the project area are mapped as Katula very cobbly loam <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(NRCS 2009). In general, the Katula series consists of deep, well-drained soils with a low water <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
capacity on uplands formed from weathered basalt (SCS 1990). The Katula soil series is not <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
listed as hydric on the national (NRCS 2011a) or Thurston County hydric soil lists (NRCS <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
2011b).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
As described in more detail in Section 3.3 (Vegetation), vegetation along the project alignment is <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
primarily Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest with a narrow corridor of red alder that is <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
associated with the unnamed tributary. Piggyback plant (Tolmiea menziesii), blue wildrye <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(Elymus glaucus), lady fern (Athryium felix-femina), and inside-out flower (Vancouveria <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
hexandra) were observed within and along the small, undefined stream channel. One obligate <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
wetland species was also observed in the stream vicinity by a FEMA Wetland Scientist during <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the site visit. These plant species are known to occur in both wetland and upland areas and are <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
typical of forest sloped areas that retain surface water for a few days after rain events with moist <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
to wet conditions. Small areas of ponded water were observed in the unnamed project tributary <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
but not in adjacent areas.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
As described in more detail in Section 2.3 (Alternative B - Proposed Action), a complete wetland <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
investigation, which would include a comprehensive field investigation of vegetation, soils, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
hydrologic conditions to determine whether conditions at the site meet wetland definition <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
criteria, was not conducted as part of the September 2010 site visit. Given the presence of some <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
wetland associated plants in the stream vicinity, it is possible that wetland conditions occur as a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
wetland fringe along the stream channel in the vicinity of the project alignment. DNR will <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
conduct a wetland investigation in the vicinity of the project alignment crossing through the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
stream drainage to determine whether wetlands are present and, if so, to determine the wetland <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
boundary.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.2.1.1 Regulatory Context<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Federal, state, and local regulations addressing hydrology, water quality, floodplains, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
wetlands in the affected environment are summarized below.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Federal Requirements<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Clean Water Act (Sections 401 and 404)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Projects funded by FEMA must comply with permit requirements for the U.S. Army Corps of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Engineers (Corps) under the CWA. Actions affecting waters of the United States (waters of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
U.S.) and that involve the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S., including <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
wetlands, are regulated by Section 404 of the CWA. Section 401 of the CWA, administered by <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Ecology, requires that activities permitted under Section 404 meet state water quality standards. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
DNR manages its forest landscapes, including the Capitol State Forest, under the guidance of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
State Trust Lands Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) (DNR 1997c). This multi-species HCP was <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
developed to address state trust land management issues related to compliance with the federal <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Endangered Species Act (16 United States Code [U.S.C.] 1531 et seq.). The HCP is a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
partnership among the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the USFWS, and DNR, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
guides the management of approximately 1.8 million acres of forested state trust lands within the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
range of the northern spotted owl. The HCP includes a riparian conservation strategy that defines <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
a riparian management zone and riparian buffers for different stream types, and the types of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
activities that can occur in these areas. Implementation of BMPs in accordance with the HCP <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
would meet or exceed CWA standards (pers. comm., Mettler 2011).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Executive Orders 11988 (Floodplain Management) and 11990 (Protection of Wetlands)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
EO 11988 (Floodplains) requires federal agencies to reduce the risk of flood loss; minimize the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
impact on human health, safety, and welfare; and restore the natural and beneficial values served <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
by floodplains. Under FEMA’s implementing regulations at 44 CFR Part 9, FEMA must evaluate <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the potential effects of any actions it may take in a floodplain and consider alternatives to avoid <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
adverse effects. Similarly, EO 11990 (Wetlands) requires that federal agencies take action to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
minimize the destruction, loss, or degradation of wetlands, and to preserve and enhance the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
natural and beneficial effects of wetlands. In planning their actions, federal agencies are required <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
to consider alternatives to wetland sites and limit potential damage if an activity affecting a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
wetland cannot be avoided. Federal agencies are also required under 44 CFR Part 9 to provide <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
public notice and review of plans for actions in floodplains and wetlands. The public notice for <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
this disaster and public review of the Draft EA meet FEMA’s public notice and review <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
obligations. As described below in Section 3.2.2 (Environmental Consequences), the Proposed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Action would not affect wetlands or floodplains.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Coastal Zone Management Act<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Federal activities or projects proposed within any of Washington's 15 coastal counties (including <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Thurston County) must be consistent with the policies of Washington’s coastal zone management <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
program. DNR is responsible for obtaining a federal consistency determination from Ecology and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
providing this determination to FEMA. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.2.2 METHODOLOGY AND THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The potential effects of the project alternatives on hydrology, water quality, floodplains, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
wetlands in the project area were evaluated in terms of both regulatory considerations and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
ecological context and intensity. This was determined by gathering and reviewing information <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
regarding rivers and streams, wetlands, floodplains, and water quality conditions in the project <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
area; determining which of these resources are present in areas potentially affected by the project <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
alternatives; and evaluating how the project alternatives could impact resources present in the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
affected environment based on the known effects of similar projects from available literature <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
sources and best professional judgment.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The presence or absence of wetlands was determined in accordance with CFR 44 Part 9.4, which <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
defines wetlands as those areas inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater with a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
frequency sufficient to support, or that under normal hydrologic conditions do or would support, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
a prevalence of vegetation or aquatic life typically adapted for life in saturated or seasonally <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
saturated soil conditions. This definition is intended to be consistent with the definition of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
wetlands in Cowardin et al. (1979) (44 CFR 9.4). In Washington state, the Corps Wetland <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Delineation Manual (Environmental Laboratory 1987) and Regional Supplement (Environmental <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Laboratory 2010) are the field methods used to evaluate whether hydrologic, vegetation, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
soils conditions meet the definition of a wetland as in 44 CFR 9.4. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
It was determined that the potentially affected environment for the Proposed Action is limited to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
hydrology, water quality, and potential wetlands; no floodplains are present in the project <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
vicinity. The project alternatives were determined to have a significant effect on hydrology, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
water quality, or wetlands if they would: <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Violate water quality standards or cause prolonged alteration to baseline water quality <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
conditions. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Alter the existing drainage pattern of streams or wetlands in a manner that would violate <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
or exceed the standards of any required permits.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Cause adverse effects on wetlands that are not minimized in accordance with FEMA’s <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
standards in 44 CFR 9.11.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Violate any local, state, or federal regulations concerning hydrology, water quality, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
wetlands, or floodplains.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.2.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This section describes the potential effects of the project alternatives on hydrology, water quality, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and wetlands within the affected environment. Measures to avoid, reduce, or mitigate any <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
identified impacts on these resources are also identified.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative A (No Action)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the No Action Alternative, as described in Section 2.2 (Alternative A - No Action), FEMA <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
would not provide funds to DNR for the Proposed Action. Without FEMA funding, DNR <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
would not construct the proposed trail reroute or rehabilitate the intact sections of the original <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
trail leading to the landslide area that are permanently closed to recreational use.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the No Action Alternative, no ground-disturbing activities would occur along the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
proposed project alignment or the closed trails. As described in Section 3.1 (Geology, Soils, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Slope Stability), without rehabilitation of the closed trails, the compacted surface soils in those <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
areas are expected to contribute to some erosion potential in the near term, although it is expected <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
to be negligible. Natural regrowth and reestablishment of vegetation, and the accumulation of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
forest litter, is expected to reduce erosion potential along the closed trails even further within <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
approximately 1–5 years. While most soil erosion would be intercepted by the immediately <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
surrounding landscape, the steep slopes could contribute to the transport of some materials <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
farther downslope. Any erosion-related delivery of sediments to aquatic resources downslope of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the closed trails and associated effects on hydrology, water quality, or wetlands are expected to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
be negligible. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative B (Proposed Action)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the Proposed Action, FEMA would provide funds to DNR for construction of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
approximately 1 mile of new motorized recreation trail, including one bridge, and the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
abandonment and rehabilitation of approximately 0.5 mile of trail not damaged in the landslide <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
that would be bypassed by the new route (as described in Section 2.3, Alternative B - Proposed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Action). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
As described in more detail in Section 2.3 (Alternative B - Proposed Action), a complete wetland <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
investigation was not conducted as part of the September 2010 site visit. DNR will conduct a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
wetland investigation in the vicinity of the project alignment crossing through the stream <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
drainage to determine whether wetlands are present and, if so, DNR will also determine the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
wetland boundary. If wetlands are present, DNR will avoid impacts on wetland resources; <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
therefore, there will be no net loss of wetland function.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Effects on water quality and hydrology in the unnamed tributary would be limited to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
construction-related activities. Construction-related activities for the bridge would occur during <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the summer when little or no water would be in the creek channel. The bridge would also be built <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
outside and above the project tributary and potentially present wetlands and be designed to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
accommodate natural hydrologic and sedimentation processes typical of these high gradient <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
headwaters. Construction-related activities from trail and bridge construction would disturb soils <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and alter surface runoff and sheet flow. In addition, temporary and permanent erosion control <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
BMPs would ensure that construction and operation of the Proposed Action would be limited to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
negligible short- and long-term impacts on hydrology and water quality. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Mitigation Measures<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The Proposed Action incorporates avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures into the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
project design and implementation and would adhere to water quality BMPs in accordance with <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the HCP. No additional mitigation measures are proposed for hydrology and water quality.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Significant Unavoidable Adverse Effects<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
No significant unavoidable effects on hydrology, water quality, floodplains, or wetlands are <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
anticipated from either of the alternatives.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.3 VEGETATION<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This section describes vegetation communities and special status plant species in the project <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
vicinity, and the potential effects of the project alternatives on these resources.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.3.1 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Vegetation Communities<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The project is located in the Capitol Forest, a 91,650-acre “working forest” southwest of Olympia <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
in Thurston and Grays Harbor counties. The Capitol Forest is both a timber-producing forest and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
a popular recreation destination. The forest is managed by the DNR Pacific Cascade Region for <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
timber production, wildlife habitat, and recreation and public access. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The project is located in previously harvested, second-growth, Douglas-fir forest that was <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
commercially thinned in 1995 (FEMA 2010). The understory consists primarily of Douglas-fir <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
saplings, red huckleberry (Vaccinium parvifolium), swordfern, salal, and Oregon grape (Mahonia <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
sp.); all upland species. The overstory transitions to red alder where the proposed project <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
alignment crosses the small seasonal stream drainage described in Section 3.2 (Hydrology, Water <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Quality, Floodplains, and Wetlands). The understory is similar within this drainage, except within <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and along the narrow, undefined stream channel. Several herbaceous plants often found in moist <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
to wet, shady forest conditions were observed in this area during the September 2010 site visit. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The predominant plant observed along the stream channel was piggyback plant. Others included <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
blue wildrye (Elymus glaucus), lady fern, and inside-out flower (Vancouveria hexandra). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Piggyback plant and lady fern are sometimes found in wetlands, while blue wildrye and inside-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
out flower are upland plants. The FEMA Wetland Scientist present during the September 2010 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
site visit also observed a sedge species in the vicinity of the stream. The species was not <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
identified at the time, but it is thought to have been an obligate wetland species. Wetlands are <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
described in detail in Section 3.2 (Hydrology, Water Quality, Floodplains, and Wetlands). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Invasive species are not a major component of vegetation communities in the project vicinity, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
none were observed along the proposed project alignment during the September 2010 site visit <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(see Figure 3.3-1, Photos of Representative Vegetation). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Special Status Plants and Rare Ecological Communities<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
In this EA, special status plant species are defined as plants that are federally listed as either <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
listed or proposed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), or that <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
are otherwise considered sensitive by state resource conservation agencies. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Two plants listed under the ESA occur in Thurston County: golden paintbrush (Castilleja <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
levisecta) and water howellia (Howellia aquatilis) (USFWS 2010). DNR maintains the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Washington Natural Heritage Program (WNHP), a database of current and historic locations of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
ESA-listed and sensitive plant species in Washington. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>

<paragraph></paragraph>
[insert figure of photos of vegetation communitiesin the project area, including Douglas-fir<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
forest, understory, and streamside vegetation]<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Neither golden paintbrush nor water howellia are documented by WNHP within the Potosi Creek <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
drainage or within the surrounding headwater drainages that form Waddell Creek (DNR 2010b). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Golden paintbrush is found in open grasslands in the Puget Trough lowlands (DNR 1997a); in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
western Washington, water howellia is found in low elevation wetlands (DNR 1997b). Habitat <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
conditions in the project vicinity are not suitable for either of these species.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.3.1.1 Regulatory Context<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Federal, state, and local regulations addressing vegetation are summarized below. While no ESA-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
listed plants occur in the project vicinity, regulatory considerations pertaining to the ESA are <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
summarized along with a brief explanation of why no further actions are needed to meet <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
regulatory requirements.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Endangered Species Act<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The ESA serves as the primary federal protection for species and habitat, by providing a formal <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
designation and implementing programs through which the conservation of both populations and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
habitats may be achieved. Two agencies are responsible for the administration of the ESA: the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
USFWS and NMFS. The USFWS is responsible for plants under the ESA. Because no ESA-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
listed plants or suitable habitat for ESA-listed plants that occur in Thurston County are present in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the project vicinity (USFWS 2010; DNR 1997a, 1997b, 2010b), no further action is required by <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
FEMA under the ESA for listed plants.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Executive Order 13112 – Invasive Species<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
EO 13112 requires federal agencies to prevent the introduction of invasive species, provide for <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
their control, and minimize the economic, ecological, and human health effects that invasive <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
species cause. In accordance with the Environmental Protection BMPs described in Section 2.3 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(Proposed Action), DNR would implement its standard BMPs for preventing the spread of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
invasive species in the Capitol Forest. No further action is required by FEMA under EO 13112.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.3.2 METHODOLOGY AND THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The potential effects of the project alternatives on vegetation were evaluated in terms of both <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
regulatory considerations and ecological context and intensity. AECOM ecologists gathered and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
reviewed available information regarding special status plants and rare ecological communities <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
documented in Thurston County and the project vicinity (primarily the Waddell Creek and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
surrounding drainages), and conducted a site visit on September 29, 2010 to collect information <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
on general site conditions, vegetation communities, and special habitat features (e.g., wetlands, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
suitable habitat for special status plants) along the proposed project alignment. The vegetation <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
resources present in areas that could potentially be affected by the project alternatives were <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
identified. Direct impacts of the project alternatives on vegetation resources were quantified, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
while potential indirect impacts of the project alternatives were qualitatively identified based on <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
best professional judgment. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
A project alternative was determined to have a significant effect on vegetation if it would: <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Substantially disturb or degrade sensitive natural communities, such as riparian or wetland <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
habitats.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Directly or indirectly alter sensitive, threatened, or endangered plants or their habitat.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Conflict with applicable federal, state, or local regulations. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.3.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This section describes the potential effects of the project alternatives on vegetation resources in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the project area. Measures to avoid, reduce, or mitigate any identified impacts on these resources <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
are also identified.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative A (No Action)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the No Action Alternative, FEMA would not provide funds to support DNR in rerouting <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the Mount Molly Loop Trail to bypass above the December 2007 landslides. Without FEMA <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
funding, DNR would not construct the proposed trail reroute or rehabilitate the intact sections of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the trail leading to the landslide area.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the No Action Alternative, no vegetation clearing would occur along the proposed project <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
alignment and no vegetation would be planted along the closed trails. The intact sections of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Mount Molly Loop Trail leading to the areas damaged in the December 2007 landslides would <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
remain permanently closed to all recreation uses. Understory shrubs that were previously brushed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
back from the trail travel way, and species such as red alder that successfully establish in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
disturbed and compacted soils, would grow over and within the closed trail relatively quickly <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(approximately 1–5 years). Over time, forest litter (leaves, needles, twigs, etc.) would <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
accumulate, and along with natural forest soils processes, would encourage the growth of other <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
vegetation. However, it could take many years for plants such as red huckleberry, swordfern, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
salal, and Oregon grape, common in the surrounding landscape, to re-establish on the closed trail.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The No Action Alternative would have a negligible adverse effect on vegetation.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative B (Proposed Action)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the Proposed Action Alternative, FEMA would provide funds to support DNR in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
rerouting the Mount Molly Mount Molly Loop Trail to bypass above the December 2007 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
landslides.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Approximately 0.5 acre of relatively dense understory vegetation, consisting primarily of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
swordfern, salal, and Oregon grape, would be permanently cleared during construction of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
proposed trail reroute. Some red huckleberry and small trees may also be removed. However, the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
final trail alignment would be routed to avoid the removal of any mature trees. Understory shrubs <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
would be brushed back as necessary (as described in Section 2.3, Alternative B – Proposed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Action) both during construction of the proposed trail reroute and as a long-term maintenance <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
activity. Vegetation along the small, undefined stream channel would be avoided during <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
construction of the trail bridge to the extent possible. However, it is probable that some trampling <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
of vegetation would occur in this area during bridge construction.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Compacted soils would be loosened, trail structures removed, and native plants, primarily <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
swordfern and salal, would be planted along approximately 0.5 mile of the Mount Molly Loop <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
that would be bypassed by the proposed trail reroute. Vegetation previously brushed back during <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
ongoing trail maintenance activities has grown, and would continue to grow, back quickly <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(approximately 1–2 years). Other native species, such as red alder, would begin to self-establish <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
relatively quickly (approximately 1–5 years). The loosened soils, accumulation of forest litter, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
natural forest soils processes would encourage the spread of other, slower growing plants that are <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
common in the surrounding forest over time. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The plant species that would be removed for the proposed trail reroute are common and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
widespread understory species in both conifer and mixed conifer-hardwood communities within <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the Capitol Forest and throughout western Washington. The herbaceous plant species observed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
along the project area stream channel are also common and widespread in moist to wet, shady <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
forest conditions throughout western Washington. The rehabilitation, including planting of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
swordfern and salal, along 0.5 mile of the closed and bypassed Mount Molly Loop Trail, would <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
partially offset the vegetation removal associated with the proposed trail reroute. However, there <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
would still be some net loss. This loss would be a minor adverse effect on vegetation locally or <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
regionally, and would have no effect on any rare, unique, wetland, or otherwise protected plant <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
species or communities.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Mitigation Measures<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The No Action and Proposed Action alternatives would both have negligible adverse effects on <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
vegetation that is common and widespread both locally and regionally, and no effect on any rare, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
unique, wetland, or otherwise protected plant species or communities. The Proposed Action <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
incorporates avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures into the project design and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
implementation and would adhere to the BMPs listed in Section 2.3. No additional mitigation <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
measures are proposed for vegetation. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Significant Unavoidable Adverse Effects<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The No Action and Proposed Action alternatives would have no significant effects on <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
vegetation.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.4 FISH AND WILDLIFE<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This section describes fish and wildlife resources in the project vicinity and the potential effects <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
of project alternatives on these resources. No federally listed threatened or endangered species or <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
suitable habitats are documented in the project area (NMFS 2011; USFWS 2011b; WDFW 2010, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
2011).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.4.1 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Fish <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
As described in Section 3.2 (Hydrology, Water Quality, Floodplains, and Wetlands), the project <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
area includes an unnamed tributary to Potosi Creek with seasonal flow that does not have <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
suitable habitat to support fish species (DNR 2011). A search of the Washington Department of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) Priority Habitats and Species (PHS) database (WDFW 2010) and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
SalmonScape (WDFW 2011) for the project area indicated no fish presence in the project area <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
tributary. The closest fish occurrence data indicated fish presence 2,000 feet downstream in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Potosi Creek, outside of the project area, where coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
clarki) is present (WDFW 2010, 2011).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Information on special-status fish species and priority habitats potentially occurring in the project <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
area was obtained from NMFS (NMFS 2011), USFWS (USFWS 2011b), WDFW PHS (WDFW <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
2010), and SalmonScape (WDFW 2011). No federally listed threatened or endangered species or <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
suitable habitat is present in the project area. The closest special status fish species data indicate <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
fish presence 5,800 feet downstream in Potosi Creek outside of the project area and includes the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
historical presence of Southwest Washington (SW) Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) coho <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
salmon (O. kisutch), a state candidate species (WDFW 2010). NMFS has determined that the SW <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
ESU coho salmon does not warrant listing as federally threatened or endangered under the ESA <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(NMFS 2011).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Wildlife <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
As described in Section 3.3 (Vegetation), the project vicinity is primarily fragmented Douglas-fir <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
forest and upland riparian areas associated with the project area tributary. These wildlife habitats <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
include areas for nesting and foraging, cover, and connectivity to the larger Waddell Creek <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
watershed and patches of mature forest. Common wildlife species in the project vicinity include <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
winter wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), American robin (Turdus migratorius), and dark-eyed junco <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(Junco hyemalis). Other wildlife species include black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
columbianus).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Information on special-status wildlife species and priority habitats potentially occurring in the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
project area was obtained from the USFWS (USFWS 2011b) and WDFW PHS (WDFW 2010). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
No wildlife species federally listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA are documented <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
in the project vicinity (WDFW 2010, USFWS 2011b). This includes no documented occurrence <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
of the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) or marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
marmoratus) in the project vicinity. No federally listed threatened or endangered species, nor <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
suitable habitat, were observed during the site reconnaissance. The project area is maintained as a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
“working forest,” which is currently fragmented and lacks structural complexity and habitat <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
elements required for the northern spotted owl and marbled murrelet. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The WDFW PHS Program data obtained for the project vicinity (T17N, R4W, Section 1 and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
T18N, R4W, Section 36) include 20 occurrences of tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) within 1 mile of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the project area (WDFW 2010). The tailed frog is a state monitor species and a federal species of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
concern (WDFW 2008, 2010; USFWS 2011b). Survey efforts occurred in 1992, 1998, 1999, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
2002, and 2003. Each occurrence documented 1 to 88 individuals (WDFW 2010). The nearest <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
documented occurrence is approximately 4,800 feet downstream of the project area (WDFW <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
2010). Tailed frogs live and breed in clear, cold, fast-flowing streams with rock or gravel bottoms <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and are most active in spring and fall (Lawrence et al. 2005). Suitable habitat for this species is <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
not present in the project area. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.4.1.1 Regulatory Context<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Endangered Species Act<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The ESA serves as the primary federal protection for species and habitat, by providing a formal <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
designation and implementing programs through which the conservation of both populations and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
habitats may be achieved. The USFWS and NMFS are responsible for the administration of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
ESA. As previously described, DNR manages its forest landscapes, including the Capitol State <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Forest, under the guidance of the State Trust Lands HCP (DNR 1997c). HCPs under section <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA provide for partnerships with non-federal parties to conserve the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
ecosystems upon which listed species depend, ultimately contributing to their recovery.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Washington’s State Trust Lands HCP (DNR 1997c) is an ecosystem-based forest management <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
plan developed by DNR to provide habitat for species such as the northern spotted owl, marbled <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
murrelet, and riparian-dependant species such as salmon (Oncorhynchus sp.) and bull trout <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(Salvelinus confluentus). These species are at some level of risk of extinction — listed as <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
threatened or endangered under the ESA. The HCP applies to Washington’s forested State Trust <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
lands within the range of the northern spotted owl. The Proposed Action is consistent with the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
strategy, objectives, provisions, and BMPs of the HCP. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Magnuson Stevens Act – Essential Fish Habitat<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The MSA mandates federal agencies that fund activities that may adversely affect the essential <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
fish habitat (EFH) of federally managed fish species to consult with NMFS regarding the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
potential adverse effects of their actions on EFH. Three federal fishery management plans and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
their associated EFHs are applicable to projects and activities within Washington state: the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Pacific coast ground fish fishery, the coastal pelagic species fishery, and the Pacific coast salmon <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
fishery. EFH does not occur in the project area, and no indirect effects on EFH are anticipated. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Therefore, EFH determination for the Proposed Action is “no adverse effect” under MSA, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
no consultation with NMFS is required. In addition, the DNR HCP (DNR 1997c) satisfies <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
consultation requirements of the MSA (USFWS and NMFS 2004).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Migratory Bird Treaty Act<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) prohibits persons, unless by permit, “to pursue, take, or <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
kill…any migratory bird, or any part, nest or egg of any such bird.” Direct and indirect acts are <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
prohibited under this definition, although harassment and habitat modification are not included <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
unless they result in the direct loss of birds, nests, or eggs. The current list of species protected by <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the MBTA includes all native birds, including many commonly found in western Washington <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
forested habitats. DNR would conduct preconstruction surveys for birds, nests, and eggs within <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the construction footprint of the project. If any species covered under the MBTA are nesting <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
within the construction footprint, DNR would coordinate with the USFWS and/or WDFW to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
determine appropriate avoidance or minimization measures and ensure compliance with the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
MBTA.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Administered by the USFWS, this law provides for the protection of the bald eagle (Haliaeetus <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
leucocephalus) and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) by prohibiting, except by permit, the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
taking, possession, and commerce of such birds. Golden eagle sightings are relatively rare in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
western Washington. There are no documented occurrences of bald eagles within 1 mile of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
project area (WDFW 2010). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.4.2 METHODOLOGY AND THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The potential effects of the project alternatives on fish and wildlife were evaluated in terms of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
both regulatory considerations and ecological context and intensity. Potential effects were <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
determined by gathering and reviewing information regarding fish, wildlife, habitat, and special <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
status species, and qualitatively evaluating how the project alternatives could impact fish, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
wildlife, habitat, and special status species based on available literature sources, project details, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and best professional judgment. Data gathering included a site visit by project ecologists and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
environmental planners to evaluate habitat in the project vicinity. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
A project alternative would reach the significance threshold for effects on fish or wildlife if it <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
would:<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Substantially interfere with the breeding, feeding, or necessary life-cycle movement of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
fish and wildlife.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Substantially conflict with any state or local regulations protecting fish, wildlife, or <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
habitat.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Substantially conflict with the provisions of an applicable species or habitat management <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
plan.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Result in the long-term degradation of streams or riparian forested habitat in the project <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
area or vicinity.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.4.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This section describes the potential effects of the project alternatives on fish and wildlife in the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
project area. Measures to avoid, reduce, or mitigate any identified impacts on these resources are <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
also identified.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative A (No Action)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the No Action Alternative, FEMA would not provide funding for the relocation of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Mount Molly Trail as described in Section 2.2 (Alternative A - No Action). Terrestrial and aquatic <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
habitat elements important to fish and wildlife would remain unaltered from their current <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
condition. There would be no effects on fish and wildlife related to the No Action Alternative.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative B (Proposed Action)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the Proposed Action, FEMA would provide funds to DNR for construction of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
approximately 1 mile of new motorized recreation trail, including one bridge, and the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
abandonment and rehabilitation of approximately 0.5 mile of trail, as described in Section 2.3 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(Alternative B - Proposed Action). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Fish<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Because there is no suitable fish habitat in the project area, implementation of the Proposed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Action would not result in short- or long-term effects on fish.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Wildlife<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the Proposed Action, construction would take place during the drier season, reducing the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
potential effects from run-off and sedimentation during construction. BMPs and a TESC Plan <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
would be implemented to prevent run-off and sedimentation from reaching streams and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
downstream aquatic wildlife habitats. Wildlife habitat would be affected by construction-related <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
activities such as grading and clearing for the trail and to install a bridge over Potosi Creek. These <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
activities are considered a minor short-term and long-term impact on wildlife from a direct loss of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
habitat from construction of 1 mile of new motorized trail (0.5 acre). However, rehabilitation of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
approximately 0.5 mile of trail not damaged in the landslide would provide new wildlife habitat <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
in the long term.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Short-term effects on wildlife caused by construction-related activities would result in noise and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
activity from light equipment and construction personnel, as described in Section 2.3, (Alternative <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
B - Proposed Action). Noise and other disturbances caused by construction crews may cause <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
wildlife to temporarily move away from the construction area. This noise would be in addition to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
baseline noise from recreation activities such as the use of motorized ORVs. Since the habitats <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
found in the project area are connected to other similar habitats, many species would temporarily <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
relocate in these nearby areas during construction. In the long term, wildlife species would return <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
to the area. The construction site for the proposed bridge does not provide habitat for the tailed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
frog. In addition, construction of the bridge would occur during the summer when the project <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
area tributary is dry and tailed frogs are not likely to be present in the immediate construction <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
zone. Overall, the Proposed Action would have minor short-term impacts from construction and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
minor long-term impacts from permanent loss of wildlife habitat.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Mitigation Measures<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The Proposed Action would adhere to BMPs described in the HCP. No additional mitigation <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
measures are necessary for fish and wildlife.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Significant Unavoidable Adverse Effects<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
No significant unavoidable effects on fish or wildlife are anticipated from either of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
alternatives. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.5 RECREATION AND VISUAL RESOURCES<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This section describes recreation and visual resources in the project vicinity, and the potential <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
effects of the project alternatives on these resources.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.5.1 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Recreational Resources<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The project is located in the northern half of the Capitol State Forest (Capitol Forest), a 91,650-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
acre working forest southwest of Olympia in Thurston and Grays Harbor counties. The Capitol <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Forest is both a timber-producing forest and a popular recreation destination. The forest is <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
managed by the DNR Pacific Cascade Region for timber production, wildlife habitat, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
recreation and public access. Recreation and public access in the forest are managed through the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
region’s Pacific Crest Conservation and Recreation District, in conjunction with the Asset <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Management and Protection Division’s recreation program based in Olympia (DNR 2005).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The Capitol Forest draws an estimated 800,000 visitors each year for hiking, horseback riding, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
camping, mountain biking, ORV use, hunting, nature study, sightseeing, and more. Recreation <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
resources within the Capitol Forest are divided into five categories: road use, facilities, trails, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
dispersed use, and organized events. The Capitol Forest contains over 575 miles of roads. Their <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
primary use is to facilitate management of the working forest. Public access is considered a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
secondary use. The Capitol Forests contains seven campgrounds, four trailheads, a self-guided <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
interpretive area, and a trail system with approximately 160 miles of trail (DNR 2005).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The Capitol Forest’s recreation management emphasis is to provide connectivity throughout the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
landscape via its motorized and non-motorized trail systems. Recreation trails are divided into <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
two separate systems – motorized and non-motorized. Motorized recreation trails are located in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the northern half of the forest (where the project is located), while non-motorized recreation trails <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
are located in the southern half of the forest (DNR 2005).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The motorized trail system in the northern half of the Capitol Forest contains 89 miles of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
motorized recreation trails. Most are multi-use trails open to ATVs, motorbikes, mountain bikes, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and hikers. While soils in the project vicinity are cobbly loam and well drained (NRCS 2009, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
SCS 1990), the clay-based soils inherent throughout much of the Capitol Forest retain water, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
requiring time to dry during the winter season (DNR 2005) (refer to Section 3.1, Geology, Soils, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and Shoreline Stability for a description of soils in the project vicinity). Since these clay-based <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
soils cannot withstand heavy winter trail use, the forest’s trails are closed for most recreation <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
users (including motorized recreation) during the winter (from December 1 through April 30). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Motorized trails are open to motorized recreation from May through November, while mountain <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
bikers and hikers may use the trails year round (DNR 2005).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The proposed project trail alignment is a reroute of a portion of the Mount Molly Loop Trail and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
another unnamed motorized recreation trail near Larch Mountain. The Mount Molly Loop Trail is <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
7.7 miles long and is open to ATVs, motorbikes, mountain bikes, and hikers (DNR 2005). The <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
unnamed trail serves the same uses. These trails are part of a network of connecting motorized <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
recreation trails around Larch Mountain. DNR closed the damaged sections of both trails to all <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
recreation use following the 2007 landslides due to the unsafe conditions (pers. comm., Wolff <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and Shedd, 2011).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The primary road access to the Larch Mountain area is the C-4000 Road from the Rock Candy <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Trailhead, although the area can be reached using forest roads from other entrances to the Capitol <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Forest as well. The motorized trails around Larch Mountain can be reached from the Rock Candy <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Trailhead (to the north), the Thurston-Grays Harbor ORV Sport Park (to the northwest), the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Middle Waddell Trailhead (southeast), or the Porter Creek campground area to the west. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Visual Resources<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The landscape surrounding the project site is characterized by open Douglas-fir forest on ridges <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and steep back slopes around Larch Mountain that were last commercially thinned in 1995. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Forest canopy along the ridge at the project site is broken with views to the west, while views to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the east are generally blocked by tall Douglas-fir trees. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Landscape-level views to the west are of the surrounding mountain tops and ridges of the Black <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Hills, including Buck Ridge. These views are generally of a patchwork of commercial forest at <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
different stages of maturity, including clearcuts. Landscape-level views to the west also include <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
views of the Olympic Mountains beyond. Forest canopy along the proposed trail alignment on <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the back slope is unbroken. While the understory is generally open, site distance is limited to the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
immediate area with no views of the surrounding landscape, except where the proposed project <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
alignment crosses the C-4500 Road. Limited views to the east of the Potosi Creek drainage are <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
possible from this location.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Site-level views along the proposed trail alignment on the ridge include the C-4500 Road and a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
connecting section of the Mount Molly Porter #3 motorized recreation trail that runs along the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
west slope of Larch Mountain, and surrounding Douglas-fir forest with some open areas along <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the road. Site-level views along the proposed alignment on the back slope are generally of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
previously thinned, open Douglas-fir forest and low shrub understory described in Section 3.3 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(Vegetation).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.5.1.1 Regulatory Context<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The State Trust Lands Habitat Conservation Plan<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
DNR manages its forested landscapes, including the Capitol State Forest, under the guidance of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the HCP, a partnership among NMFS, USFWS, and DNR (DNR 1997c). Under the HCP, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
development of recreation sites must adhere to the riparian conservation strategy (HCP Chapter <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
IV.D). Under the HCP, the trail system must be managed adequately to protect wildlife habitats, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
including riparian species. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The Capitol State Forest Recreation and Public Access Plan<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The Capitol State Forest Recreation and Public Access Plan guides DNR in the management of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
public use at recreation sites, on trails, and across the landscapes within the Capitol State Forest <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(DNR 2005). The recreation guidelines within the plan direct ORV use to the northern half of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
forest and equestrian use to the southern half; allow mountain biking year round throughout the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
entire forest; and restrict certain trail uses to the dry time of the year, among other guidelines.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.5.2 METHODOLOGY AND THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The potential effects of the project alternatives on recreation and visual resources were evaluated <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
in terms of regulatory and recreation management considerations, context, and intensity. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
AECOM environmental planners gathered and reviewed available information regarding <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
recreation resources and activities, and visual resources in the Capitol Forest, and conducted a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
site visit on September 29, 2010 to collect information on general site conditions in the project <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
vicinity (along, adjacent, connecting, or visible from the proposed project alignment). Recreation <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and visual resources present in areas that could potentially be affected by the project alternatives <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
were identified. Direct impacts of the project alternatives on recreation and visual resources were <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
quantified where possible or evaluated qualitatively where quantitative data did not exist or were <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
not applicable. Potential indirect impacts of the project alternatives were qualitatively identified <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
based on best professional judgment.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
A project alternative was determined to have a significant effect on recreation or visual resources <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
if it would:<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Substantially increase safety hazards from conflicts between recreationists and forestry <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
activities, or from high ORV speeds.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Increase the use of or exceed the capacity of the existing recreational resources such that <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
substantial physical deterioration would occur or be accelerated.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Substantially affect the quantity or quality of recreational resources, opportunities, or <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
activities in the Capitol Forest. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Substantially alter views or the natural visual character of the area.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.5.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This section describes the potential effects of the project alternatives on recreational and visual <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
resources in the project area. Measures to avoid, reduce, or mitigate for any identified impacts on <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
recreational and visual resources are also identified.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative A (No Action)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Recreational Resources<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the No Action Alternative, FEMA would not provide funds to support DNR in rerouting <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the Mount Molly Loop Trail to bypass above the December 2007 landslides that damaged <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
sections of two motorized recreation trails in that area. Without FEMA funding, DNR would not <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
construct the proposed trail reroute or rehabilitate the intact sections of trail leading to the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
landslide area. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the No Action Alternative, recreationists would lose the use of approximately 1 mile of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
motorized recreation trail in the Larch Mountain area of the Capitol Forest indefinitely. With <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
approximately 89 miles of motorized recreation trail available, this equates to a loss of just over 1 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
percent of motorized recreation trail in the Capitol Forest, a minor loss. This would have a minor <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
adverse effect on the quantity of recreation resources for motorized recreation in the Capitol <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Forest. It would have a negligible effect on the quantity of recreation resources for non-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
motorized recreation as there are at least 160 miles of trail open to non-motorized recreation.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The permanent loss of a 1-mile section of the Mount Molly Loop Trail would force recreationists <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
to travel the C-4000 Road for about 1 mile to complete a modified version of the Mount Molly <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Loop Trail route. Recreationists may choose to skip this route altogether, and use of connecting <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
trails may increase. This is anticipated to have a minor adverse effect on the quality of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
recreation experience. It is not likely to increase the use of connecting trails to such a degree that <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
it would exceed their capacity to support the use. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The Capitol Forest is a working forest with ongoing timber harvest activities, including forestry <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
vehicles traveling forest roads. It is likely that some recreationists (especially ATV, motorbike, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and mountain biker users who often travel loop routes multiple times) would travel the C-4000 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Road to complete the Mount Molly Loop because there is no off-road through trail access. This <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
would increase potential safety hazards from conflicts between recreationists and forestry <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
vehicles. Additionally, according to DNR (pers. comm., Wolff and Shedd, 2011), ORV users <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
tend to travel faster on forest roads than on trails, further increasing the potential for conflicts to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
occur. However, it would only be necessary for recreationists to use about 1 mile of the C-4000 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Road, so this is anticipated to have only a moderate adverse effect on recreation.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Overall, the No Action Alternative would have a moderate long-term adverse impact on <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
motorized recreation in the Capitol Forest.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Visual Resources<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the No Action Alternative, no construction activities would take place and no physical <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
changes would occur. Therefore, the No Action Alternative would have no effect on site- or <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
landscape-level views, and would not change the natural visual character of the area.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative B (Proposed Action)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Recreational Resources<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the Proposed Action, FEMA would provide funds to support DNR in rerouting the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Mount Molly Loop Trail to bypass above the December 2007 landslides that damaged sections of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
two motorized recreation trails in that area. Under the Proposed Action, recreationists would <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
regain the use of approximately 1 mile of motorized recreation trail in the Larch Mountain area, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
enabling through-access along the Mount Molly Loop Trail and providing them with a safer <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
alternative to using the C-4000 Road, reducing potential safety hazards from conflicts with <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
forestry vehicles. Overall, this would have a moderate beneficial effect on recreation. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Visual Resources<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the Proposed Action, the proposed trail reroute would have a negligible impact on visual <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
resources at the site level. The proposed project would have no effect on landscape-level views, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
nor would it alter the natural visual character of the area around Larch Mountain. The proposed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
trail reroute would be visible along the ridge from the C-4000 Road in some locations; however, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
dense, low shrubs would hide most of the trail from view except at close distances. The portion <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
of the trail reroute that would switch back down the slope would be more visible from the C-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
4000 Road as it would be viewed from above. This would alter the current view; however, given <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
that the project site is located in an existing motorized recreation area and in a working forest <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
(where roads are common and viewer sensitivity is relatively low), this is considered only a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
negligible adverse effect on visual resources. Rehabilitation of the bypassed trail sections <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
damaged in the December 2007 landslides would partially offset this negligible adverse impact <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
by restoring the approximately 0.5 mile of motorized recreation trail to more closely resemble the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
surrounding landscape.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Mitigation Measures<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
No mitigation measures have been identified to offset the moderate long-term adverse impact on <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
recreation resources under the No Action Alternative. No mitigation measures have been <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
identified to offset the negligible adverse impact on visual resources under the Proposed Action.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Significant Unavoidable Adverse Effects<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The project alternatives would have no significant unavoidable adverse impacts on recreation or <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
visual resources in the project vicinity. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.6 CULTURAL RESOURCES <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This section describes cultural resources in the project vicinity, including historic and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
archaeological resources, the regulatory framework governing cultural resources management, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and the potential effects of the project alternatives on these resources.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.6.1 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Prehistory<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The prehistory of the southern Puget Sound region is divided into three periods, Early (8000–<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
5000 Before Present [B.P.]), Middle (5000–1000 B.P.), and Late (1000–250 B.P.) (Wessen and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Stilson 1987). Human land use and subsistence/settlement patterns in the southern Puget Sound <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
region developed over time from mobile, seasonal foraging of aquatic and nearshore resources in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the Early Period, to more sedentary winter villages and seasonal camps focused on specialized <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
resource exploitation in the Middle to Late Periods. Early Period material culture is dominated by <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
stone tool technology; perishable items made of wood and plant fibers are rare to nonexistent in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
all but Late Period sites (Wessen and Stilson 1987). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Expected archaeological site types and features in the project area might include temporary <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
camps established for the collection of waterfowl, small mammals, and fish. Such camps would <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
be characterized by hearths, burned bone, fire-affected rock, stone tools and debitage. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Ethnography<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
During protohistoric and historic times, the southern Puget Sound region was home to several <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
bands of the Nisqually Indians, a Coast Salish language group (Smith 1940; Spier 1936). The <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Nisqually Indians occupied the Nisqually River drainage from its origin at Mount Rainier to the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
mouth of the river northeast of Olympia, as well as the adjacent southern Puget Sound coastal <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
area. As with other Salish groups, the Nisqually relied on salmon as a staple resource, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
supplemented by other aquatic resources, terrestrial fauna (deer, waterfowl, and small mammals) <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and plant resources, including roots, nuts, and berries. Nisqually economic and social life focused <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
on permanent (winter) villages along rivers and tributaries. In warmer months, family groups <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
traveled to temporary camps along the prairie margins and elsewhere to harvest specific <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
resources. In late summer and fall, food resources were harvested and processed for winter <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
storage. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Nearby, the Upper Chehalis occupied the inland areas to the south, including Douglas-fir and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
prairie land, which was maintained by annual burning (Hajda 1990; Spier 1936). Salmon played a <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
major role in subsistence and were acquired by the Upper Chehalis from the Chehalis River and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
its tributaries. In the winter months, gable-roofed houses were constructed of cedar, and usually <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
housed 8 to 12 families (Adamson 1927; Hajda 1990).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
History<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
European settlement of Puget Sound began when Hudson’s Bay Company established Fort <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Nisqually in 1833, which became the hub of fur-trading activity on the sound. By the time Great <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Britain relinquished control of the region to the United States in the 1840s, nearly 4,000 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Americans had settled in lower Puget Sound<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
In 1854, the Medicine Creek Treaty between the U.S. government and representatives of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Nisqually, as well as those of the Puyallup and Squaxin Island peoples, was signed in exchange <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
for 2.5 million acres of traditional lands in western Washington. The Nisqually Reservation was <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
established in 1854, after which American settlers began to settle and farm the prairie lands the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Nisqually once occupied. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The Capitol State Forest is part of trust lands either granted by Congress when Washington <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
became a state in 1889, or acquired later as Forest Board trust lands. Capitol State Forest was <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
opened to the public in 1955, and state law passed in 1971 allowed for multiple use, including <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
hiking, hunting, ATV riding, camping, horseback riding, and fishing. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.6.1.1 Regulatory Context<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Federal Requirements<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Section 106 of the NHPA requires federal agencies to take into account the effects of their <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
undertakings on properties on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) a reasonable opportunity to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
comment. The historic preservation review process mandated by Section 106 is outlined in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
regulations (36 CFR 800) issued by ACHP.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
FEMA Region X has in place a Programmatic Agreement with the Washington State Department <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (DAHP) and the EMD to streamline Section 106 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
review for FEMA-assisted actions within the state (FEMA et al. 2007, 2011). FEMA is <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
consulting with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) within DAHP in accordance with <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the process and timeline in the Programmatic Agreement. FEMA received concurrence from the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
DAHP (on behalf of the SHPO) with its finding in a letter dated June 27, 2011 (Appendix A). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
FEMA is also consulting under Section 106 with Tribes (Nisqually, Skokomish, Quinault, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Squaxin Island, Chehalis, and Shoalwater Bay) for whom religious and cultural properties on or <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
eligible for the NRHP may be affected by the project.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
State Requirements<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Indian Graves and Records (RCW 27.44)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 27.44 protects Native American graves, cairns, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
glyptic markings by imposing criminal and civil fines and penalties for disturbing these sites, as <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
well as the possession and sale of artifacts.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Abandoned and Historic Cemeteries and Historic Graves Act (RCW 68.60)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This act protects cemeteries and historic graves from mutilation, injury, destruction, or removal. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Deliberate desecration of these cultural resources is a Class C felony.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.6.2 METHODOLOGY AND THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Review of literature and records, as well as a predictive model for archaeological resources <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
potential, was completed. The statewide predictive model (the Washington Information System <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
for Architectural and Archaeological Records Data [WISAARD], developed by the DAHP) is <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
based on statewide information, using large-scale factors. Information on geology, soils, site <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
types, landforms, and General Land Office (GLO) maps was used to establish or predict <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
probabilities for prehistoric cultural resources throughout the state. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
A project alternative would reach the significance threshold if it would diminish or destroy the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
integrity of a property that is on or eligible for the NRHP, for which effects cannot be resolved <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
or mitigated.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
When there are no historic properties present, or the action will have no impact on historic <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
properties, the action is considered to have no effect.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.6.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
This section describes the potential effects of the project alternatives (A and B) on cultural <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
resources.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative A (No Action)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under Alternative A, FEMA would not provide funds to DNR, and no ground-disturbing <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
activities would take place. As a result, Alternative A would result in no effect on cultural <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
resources.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative B (Proposed Action)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Under the Proposed Action, FEMA would provide funds to DNR to construct a section of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
motorized recreation trail to bypass the landslide area and C-4500 Road and trail sections, as well <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
as construct new trail, build a bridge, and rehabilitate an abandoned portion of trail. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Approximately 1 mile of trail no more than 6 feet wide would be cleared, removing surface soil <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
down to mineral soils. This action has the potential to disturb unknown cultural resources. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Since there are no recorded cultural resources within the vicinity of the project area of potential <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
effects (APE), and the DAHP predictive model and online database reviews show a low <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
potential for archaeological sites within the APE, FEMA has made a determination of No <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Historic Properties Affected. This information was provided in consultation letters with the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
SHPO and the Tribes listed above. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
If any unanticipated cultural resources are found during construction, all work would cease and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
appropriate actions would be taken, following inadvertent discovery protocols.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Mitigation Measures<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The No Action and Proposed Action alternatives would have no effect on cultural resources. As <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
a result, no mitigation measures are necessary. As noted above, if unanticipated cultural resources <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
are uncovered during project construction, all work would cease and appropriate actions would <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
be taken.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Significant Unavoidable Adverse Effects<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
No historically significant cultural resources were located in within the project APE. As a result, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the No Action and Proposed Action alternatives would have no effect on historically significant <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
cultural resources.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.7 ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Environmental justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement in the development and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
implementation of environmental laws, regulations, and policies, of all people regardless of race, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
color, national origin, or income. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.7.1 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
As previously described in Section 3.5 (Recreation and Visual Resources), the project area is in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Capitol State Forest, which is public land managed by DNR, and a popular place for a variety of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
recreation opportunities (e.g., camping, hiking, hunting, equestrian use, mountain biking, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
ORV use). Open to the public since 1955, the Capitol Forest primarily serves the surrounding <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
areas of Thurston County. Therefore, the affected area is defined as the population of Thurston <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
County for the purpose of determining the existence of a low-income and/or minority population. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Statistics for the state of Washington are also provided for comparison and context. Table 3.7-1 <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
presents the race and ethnicity of Thurston County and Washington state residents as reported by <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the U.S. Census of Population and Housing using 2009 data (U.S. Census Bureau 2011).<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Table 3.7-1. Race/Ethnicity in Thurston County and Washington State, 2009.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
[insert table summarinzg U.S. Census Bureau 2011 data].<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Low-income households are defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as those households with <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
incomes at or below 80 percent of area median household income. For 2008 (the most recent year <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
for which data are available), the median household income in Thurston County was estimated at <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
$62,146; for Washington as a whole, it was $58,081 (U.S. Census Bureau 2011). Approximately <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
9.7 percent of the Thurston County population lived below the poverty threshold, compared to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
11.3 percent of the population of Washington as a whole.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.7.1.1 Regulatory Context<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
EO 12898 (Environmental Justice, 59 Federal Register [FR] 7629) requires federal agencies to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
achieve environmental justice by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and adverse <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
human health or environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
low-income populations. Potential effects are evaluated by examining the demographics of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
area affected by the proposed action(s) and the potential of those actions to have <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
disproportionately high and adverse effects on minority and low-income populations. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.7.2 METHODOLOGY AND THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Environmental justice effects were determined using the EPA’s guidance for federal agencies to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
identify disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
populations and low-income populations (EPA 1998). According to these guidelines, a minority <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
population refers to a minority group that has a population of greater than 50 percent of the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
affected area's general population (EPA 1998). Although not specifically stated in EPA’s <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
guidance, the same rule is used for low-income populations; a low-income population exists if <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
there is a community whose general population comprises 50 percent or more people living under <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the threshold for low income. A project alternative would reach the significance threshold for <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
environmental justice if it would:<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
*Have disproportionately high and adverse environmental or health impacts on low-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
income or minority populations.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.7.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative A (No Action)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The general population of the affected area (Thurston County) does not include minority or low-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
income populations as defined under EPA’s environmental justice guidance (EPA 1998). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Therefore, the effects on these populations are not disproportionately high, and the No Action <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative would have no environmental justice effects.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Alternative B (Proposed Action)<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The general population of the affected area (Thurston County) does not include minority or low-<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
income populations as defined under EPA’s environmental justice guidance (EPA 1998). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Therefore, the effects on these populations are not disproportionately high, and the Proposed <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Action would have no environmental justice effects.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Mitigation Measures<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The project would have no environmental justice effects, and no mitigation measures are <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
necessary.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Significant Unavoidable Adverse Effects<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The project would have no significant unavoidable adverse environmental justice effects. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.8 CLIMATE CHANGE<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The CEQ has issued a draft NEPA guidance document encouraging federal agencies to improve <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
their consideration of the effects on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change in their <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
evaluations of proposals subject to NEPA documentation (CEQ 2010). Governor Gregoire <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
committed Washington state to prepare for and adapt to the impacts of climate change as part of <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Executive Order 07-02. A new focus sheet entitled “Preparing for Impacts” is available from <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Ecology’s website (Ecology 2008b). <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Although the cause of the December 2007 disaster cannot be attributed to climate change, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
changes in precipitation patterns and volatility in precipitation-driven systems, such as the Potosi <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Creek drainage, cannot be ruled out for potential damage in the future due to events associated <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
with climate change. This alternate project (the Proposed Action), which would relocate a section <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
of the Mount Molly Loop Trail to a location higher in the drainage where it would partially <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
follow a ridgeline then switch back down the east slope of the ridge following relatively flat to <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
low-gradient (0–5 percent) natural benches for most of the route, would substantially reduce the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
potential future threat of damage to the motorized recreation trail due to events brought on by <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
climate change.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Construction and maintenance of the project would result in emissions from equipment operation <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and worker transportation that would negligibly increase short-term greenhouse gas emissions.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Rerouting the trail would not increase total vehicle trips on forest access roads or increase <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
motorized recreation to a measurable degree within the motorized trail system of the Capitol <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Forest. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
No mitigation measures are proposed for the project alternatives related to climate change <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
impacts.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
3.9 CUMULATIVE EFFECTS <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Cumulative effects are those that result from the incremental effect of a Proposed Action when <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions, regardless of what <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
agency or person undertakes such other action (40 CFR 1508.7). The study area for the analysis <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
of cumulative effects in this EA is the Potosi Creek drainage. Past, present, and future actions in <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the Potosi Creek drainage include DNR road and trail construction and maintenance activities, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
timber harvest activities, and recreation use. These types of activities would typically have <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
varying levels of effects on vegetation, soils and slope stability, hydrology, water quality, fish <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
and wildlife, and visual resources due to vegetation removal and soil disturbing activities. The <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Proposed Action would contribute negligibly to these effects.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
4.0 Consultation & Coordination<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
4.1 PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
FEMA sent a scoping letter to agencies, Tribes, and local interested parties on March 4, 2011. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The letter described the proposed project and requested comments on issues and concerns, the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
range of alternatives, and potential effects regarding the project. The scoping letter and the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
comments received are included in Appendix A. These comments were considered and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
addressed in the preparation of this Draft EA. <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
4.1.1 COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT EA<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
The Draft EA will be released for public review. Copies will be sent directly to those agencies, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Tribes, and stakeholders that participated in scoping and are listed in Chapter 6, Distribution. A <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
public notice announcing its availability to the general public for comment will be posted on <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
DNR’s website and at the Rock Candy Mountain Trailhead in the Capitol Forest, and the Draft <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
EA will be available for viewing at a library or other location accessible to the public in the local <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
community. The Public Notice and Draft EA will be posted to the FEMA website, the web <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
address of which will be included in the Public Notice.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
There will be a 30-day comment period on the Draft EA. Comments from this public review will <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
be reviewed and analyzed, and the document revised as appropriate. A Final EA, and a decision <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
as to whether a FONSI or an EIS notice of intent is required, will be provided on the FEMA <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
website.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
4.2 AGENCIES AND TRIBES<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
FEMA is consulting with federal agencies, Tribes, and local agencies and stakeholders <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
throughout the EA process to gather valuable input and to meet regulatory requirements. This <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
coordination was integrated with the analysis of project effects and the public involvement <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
process.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
Because no species are present that are federally listed as threatened or endangered under the <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
ESA, no consultation with the USFWS or NMFS is required. Because no EFH is present under <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
the MSA, no consultation with NMFS is required for that purpose either.<paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
FEMA is consulting with the SHPO, the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation, and <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
with the Nisqually, Skokomish, Quinault, Squaxin Island, Chehalis, and Shoalwater Bay Tribes, <paragraph></paragraph>
<paragraph></paragraph>
requesting help in identifying traditional cultural properties that may be affected by the project. <paragraph></paragraph>
