John likes red ducks. I like blue ducks but John (Jameson et. al), in addition to liking red ducks also (Hopkins 1992) despises blue ducks and green ducks. Orange ducks, while they are by definition neither blue nor green, take umbrage to John's dislike of blue and green ducks. Teal ducks are indifferent to it all. Indeed, it was a sad day when, as you so eloquently put it, "our time was now past". John likes red ducks.
