1.0 Purpose and Need for Action

1.1 INTRODUCTION

Heavy rains in December 2007 caused severe landslides, mudslides, and flooding in western 
Washington. The rains caused slope failures (landslides) at two nearby sites in the Potosi Creek 
drainage in the Capitol State Forest (or Capitol Forest) in Thurston County, Washington. The 
landslides destroyed portions of the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) C-4500 Road and 
parallel sections (totaling approximately 400 linear feet) of the Mount Molly Loop Trail and 
another unnamed motorized recreation trail located near and downhill of the road (see Figure 
1.1-1, Project Location). The photo below shows the slope failure at one of the sites along the C-
4500 Road that destroyed a 350-foot long section of motorized recreation trail downhill of the 
road.

The president declared the storm event a major disaster (FEMA 1734-DR-WA), making federal 
funding available for emergency work and repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities. 
DNR has decided not to rebuild the C-4500 Road at the two landslide areas due to the 
extremely high cost of repair. Rebuilding the forest road at the two damaged sites would require 
stabilizing steep slopes (50 percent and greater) (pers. comm., Wolff and Shedd, 2011), blasting a 
bench in solid rock, and placing large quantities of fill material for the road bed. The cost to 
restore the C-4500 Road to pre-disaster conditions has been estimated at $3.3 million at one site 
and $9,600 at the other site (FEMA 2010). Rebuilding the trails without rebuilding the road 
would still require much of the same slope stabilization, rock blasting, and fill placement. As 
DNR has decided not to rebuild the C-4500 Road, the damaged sections of motorized recreation 
trail cannot reasonably be rebuilt in their original locations. Therefore, DNR has applied through 
the Washington State Emergency Management Division (EMD) to the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) for funding of an alternate project. The alternate project would 
combine and reroute the damaged sections of the motorized recreation trail to bypass above the 
landslide areas. The alternate project does not include rebuilding or rerouting the damaged C-
4500 Road. 

This Draft Environmental Assessment (EA) has been prepared to help FEMA meet its 
environmental review responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 
1969, the Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ’s) implementing regulations (40 Code of 
Federal Regulations [CFR] Parts 1500 through 1508), and FEMA’s implementing regulations (40 
CFR Part 10). FEMA is also using the EA to document compliance with other applicable federal 
laws and executive orders, including the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Magnuson-Stevens 
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), the National Historic Preservation Act 
(NHPA), Executive Order (EO) 11988 (Floodplains), EO 11990 (Wetlands), and EO 12898 
(Environmental Justice).

FEMA will use the findings in and public comments on this Draft EA to determine whether to 
prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). If the action is determined not to significantly 
affect the quality of the human and natural environments, then FEMA will make a Finding of No 
Significant Impact (FONSI), and preparation of an EIS will not be warranted. 

This document describes the purpose and need for the Proposed Action, the project alternatives, 
the affected environment and potential impacts on that environment resulting from the 
alternatives, cumulative effects, public involvement, and resources consulted.

1.2 BACKGROUND AND LOCATION

The project is located near Larch Mountain in the northern half of the Capitol Forest, 
approximately 10 miles southwest of Olympia in Thurston County, Washington (see Figure 1.1-
1). The Capitol Forest is a 91,650-acre “working forest” located southwest of Olympia in 
Thurston and Grays Harbor counties. The forest is managed by the DNR Pacific Cascade Region 
for timber production, wildlife habitat, and recreation and public access. The Capitol Forest has 
been open to the public since 1955 and draws an estimated 800,000 visitors each year for hiking, 
horseback riding, camping, mountain biking, off-road vehicle (ORV) use, hunting, nature study, 
sightseeing, and more. 

The Capitol Forest is divided into to two parts to prevent conflicts between motorized and non-
motorized recreation. Motorized recreation, such as ORV use, is allowed in the northern half of 
the forest, and horseback riding is limited to the south. Mountain bikers and hikers use both 
halves of the forest, with some trails limited to hikers only. 

The Mount Molly Loop Trail is a 7.7-mile long motorized trail open to all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), 
motorbikes, mountain bikes, and hikers. The other unnamed trail damaged by the landslide is a 
motorized trail open for the same uses. DNR closed the damaged sections of both trails to all 
recreation use following the 2007 landslides due to the unsafe conditions (pers. comm., Wolff. 
and Shedd, 2011). Both the damaged trail sections and the proposed trail reroute are located 
within Township 18 North, Range 4 West, Section 36 and Township 17 North, Range 4 West, 
Section 1. The coordinates of the damaged trail sections are: (Site 1) N 46.997 (latitude) / W-
123.123 (longitude), and (Site 2) N 46.995 / W-123.125. The proposed trail reroute is 
approximately 1 mile long. The beginning and ending coordinates of the trail reroute are: (north 
end) N 46.998 / W -123.119 and (south end) N 46.993 / W-123.125 (see Figure 1.1-1, Project 
Location).

The parallel sections of motorized recreation trail that were destroyed in the December 2007 
landslides were located near and downhill from the C-4500 Road. The proposed alignment for 
the rerouted trail would bypass above the landslide area. The rerouted trail would begin at the C-
4000 Road and would follow the ridge slightly north of the C-4000 Road for a portion of the 
route, then cross over the road and drop down the hill to connect with an intact section of the C-
4500 Road beyond the landslide area. The trail would follow the road for approximately 25 feet, 
then reconnect to the intact portion of the Mount Molly Loop Trail beyond the landslide area (see 
Figure 1.1-1, Project Location).

1.3 PURPOSE AND NEED

The purpose of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1973 
(Stafford Act), as amended, is to provide a range of federal assistance to state and local 
governments to supplement efforts and resources in alleviating damage or loss from major 
disasters and/or emergencies. The objective of the FEMA Public Assistance (PA) Grant Program 
is to provide assistance to state, tribal, and local governments, and certain types of Private Non-
Profit (PNP) organizations so that communities can quickly respond to and recover from major 
disasters or emergencies declared by the president. Through the PA Grant Program, FEMA 
provides supplemental federal disaster grant assistance for debris removal, emergency protective 
measures, and the repair, replacement, restoration, or relocation of disaster-damaged, publicly 
owned facilities and the facilities of certain PNP organizations. 

The need for the FEMA action is to provide funds to DNR to restore the trail function that was 
lost in the December 2007 landslides. The damaged trail sections provided through-access along 
the motorized trail network and off of the forest roads in the Larch Mountain area.
To meet the project need, DNR identified the following objectives: 


*	Reduce safety hazards arising from: (1) conflicts between recreationists and timber 
harvest activities by providing a trail for ATV, motorbike, mountain bike, and hiking use 
as an alternative to using the C-4000 Road; and (2) higher ORV speeds associated with 
traveling on roads rather than ORV trails, which are designed to reduce ORV speeds.
*	Restore through-access along the motorized trail network in a geologically stable area to 
reduce the risk of future trail damage from landslides.
*	Minimize ground disturbance, stream and wetland crossings, and tree removal.
*	Minimize costs.

1.4 RELATED ACTIONS

As stated previously, the December 2007 storms damaged multiple facilities at various sites on 
forest land owned by the DNR. DNR has requested FEMA funding to repair some of these 
damaged sites and to fund other alternate projects such as removing or replacing culverts that 
block fish passage. Although these projects are related under the same disaster (FEMA 1734-DR-
WA), they are being addressed under separate NEPA processes from the Mount Molly Loop 
Trail Reroute. DNR has no plans in the foreseeable future to repair the C-4500 Road. According 
to DNR, the timber harvest and other natural resources previously accessed via the C-4500 Road 
can be accessed via other routes. There are no known actions related to the Proposed Action 
evaluated in this EA.

1.5 RESOURCE TOPICS NOT ADDRESSED IN DETAIL IN THE EA

The CEQ and FEMA regulations (44 CFR Section 10) that implement NEPA require NEPA 
documents to be concise, focus on the issues relevant to the project, and exclude extraneous 
background data and discussion of subjects that are not relevant or would not be affected by the 
project alternatives. Accordingly, the following subjects are not evaluated in detail for the 
following reasons:



Land Use and Socioeconomics
The project alternatives would not affect land use or socioeconomic 
conditions in the project vicinity.

Transportation and Access
The project alternatives would not affect transportation and vehicle 
access in the project vicinity. Trail access is addressed under Recreation.

Air Quality
The project is located in a rural area with a low population density and 
low traffic volumes. Construction would create a limited amount of dust 
and minor vehicle emissions from vehicles bringing in materials; 
however, impacts would be temporary and minor. Air quality impacts are 
not expected to increase above current levels. No long-term reduction in 
air quality is expected once construction activities are completed.

Noise
The project is located in a motorized recreation area; it is not anticipated 
to change the existing noise environment. Noise-related impacts are 
addressed as appropriate in Section 3.4, Fish and Wildlife.

[insert 8.5x11 color figure showing damage sites, proposed trail reroute, the forest road network,
and other site features]


2.0 Alternatives, Including the Proposed Action

The CEQ regulations require federal agencies to consider a reasonable range of alternatives that 
meet the purpose and need of a proposed action in their NEPA review. Reasonable alternatives 
are alternative ways of meeting a project need, but with varying degrees of environmental 
impact. Alternatives that would clearly result in substantially greater environmental impact than 
the Proposed Action do not require detailed analysis. 

The following sections describe the alternatives being considered for the Mount Molly Loop Trail 
Reroute Project, and the process used to develop these alternatives. Although the December 
2007 landslides in the Capitol State Forest also destroyed portions of the DNR C-4500 Road, 
the Proposed Action evaluated in this EA does not include rebuilding or rerouting the road. 
DNR has no plans in the foreseeable future to restore the access lost from the December 2007 
landslide damage to the C-4500 Road. The timber harvest and other natural resources previously 
accessed via the C-4500 Road can be accessed via other routes.
This EA analyzes two alternatives for the project: Alternative A (No Action Alternative) and 
Alternative B (Proposed Action). It also describes alternatives that were considered but not 
carried forward for further analysis. 

2.1 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT NOT CARRIED FORWARD

Rebuild the Damaged Sections of the Motorized Recreation Trails near the C-4500 Road in 
their Original Locations

As described in Section 1.1 (Introduction), DNR considered rebuilding the damaged C-4500 
Road and damaged sections of motorized recreation trail to pre-disaster conditions in their 
original locations. However, this would require stabilizing the failed slope at both sites, blasting 
in solid rock to create a bench to perch fill on, and placing large quantities of fill to rebuild the 
road bed and trails. The cost to accomplish this is extremely high (estimated at $3.3 million for 
one site and $9,600 for the other site) in comparison to the Proposed Action, which is limited to a 
trail project to bypass the landslide area (estimated at $22,722 – $26,722). Given the steep slopes 
(50 percent and greater), bedrock, and shallow, exposed soils at the two damaged sites, 
rebuilding the C-4500 Road and damaged trail sections in the same locations would also have 
considerably greater impacts on geology, soils, and slope stability than the Proposed Action. For 
these reasons, rebuilding the motorized trail sections in their original locations was eliminated 
from further consideration.

2.2 ALTERNATIVE A – NO ACTION

Under the No Action Alternative, FEMA would not provide funding to DNR to reroute the 
Mount Molly Loop Trail to bypass the landslide areas. The damaged trail sections would remain 
unusable and closed to recreational use permanently. 
DNR could choose to move forward with rerouting the trail without FEMA funding. However, 
the potential for this to occur is entirely speculative; therefore, the No Action Alternative 
assumes that the damaged trail sections would remain in their current condition indefinitely for 
the purposes of analysis in this EA.

2.3 ALTERNATIVE B – PROPOSED ACTION

Under the Proposed Action, FEMA would provide funding to DNR to construct a section of 
motorized recreation trail to bypass above the 2007 landslide area and the damaged C-4500 
Road and trail sections. The Proposed Action includes the construction of approximately 1 mile 
of new motorized recreation trail, including one bridge, and the abandonment and rehabilitation 
of approximately 0.5 mile of trail not damaged in the landslide that would be bypassed by the 
new route (see Figure 1.1-1, Project Location). 

The estimated cost to build the trail is $17,722.00 (FEMA 2010). The trail bridge is estimated to 
cost an additional $5,000 to $9,000 including engineering and materials (pers. comm., Wolff and 
Shedd, 2011). The estimate includes design, bridge engineering and fabrication, materials, and 
labor costs for the proposed project. General construction activities and best management 
practices (BMPs) identified as part of the project are described in detail below.
The project would include the following construction activities:

*	Mobilizing equipment and staging materials. Construction equipment would include 
motorized/mechanical equipment and hand tools, including pick-up trucks for crew 
transport (three pick-ups trips per day at 2 hrs/day), three ATVs with trailer units to 
transport surfacing rock, a “trail machine” that is equivalent to a wheel loader-backhoe to 
load the rock into the ATV trailers, mini-excavators, chain saws, weed-eaters, and 
shovels. All equipment and materials would be staged (temporarily stored) within 
already-disturbed areas, such as wide areas along the C-4000 Road.
*	Clearing, brushing, and grubbing. Vegetation clearing would involve the removal of 
shrubs and herbaceous vegetation to a 4-foot wide alignment along the trail length. The 
exact trail alignment would be determined in the field to avoid trees to the extent 
possible. It may be necessary to remove a few small trees (up to 5-inches diameter at 
breast height [dbh] maximum). Surface soil would be removed down to mineral soils 
along the 4-foot wide alignment for the length of the trail. Vegetation would be brushed 
(cut back) beyond the traveled surface width to 6 feet wide and 8 feet high along the trail 
length. Vegetation and soil removed for the project would be scattered onto the 
surrounding landscape.

*	Constructing the trail. As described above, the trail would have a 4-foot wide travel 
surface and be brushed beyond the travel surface width to 6 feet wide and 8 feet high 
along the trail length. Trail construction would primarily be accomplished using a mini-
excavator with some work done by hand. 

*	Hardening the trail. Sections of the trail where the surface is soft and/or wet, primarily 
on both sides of the stream crossing (including the bridge approaches), would be 
hardened to reduce erosion. This would be accomplished by placing and compacting 2 
inches of crushed rock up to 1½ inches in size in these areas. It is estimated that 
approximately 130 cubic yards of crushed rock would be required. The crushed rock 
would be purchased from a commercial source and transported from the C-4000 Road to 
sites as needed using ATV trailer units. 

*	Installing/constructing drainage control structures. The trail would be constructed to 
avoid continuous grades so that water will periodically flow from the trail, rather than 
along it. Water diversions, such as grade reversals and drain dips, would be constructed 
where necessary. Drain dips are shallow depressions in the trail surface typically filled 
with crushed rock that direct small amounts of surface water across the trail and avoid the 
collection of water on the uphill side of the trail. 

*	Constructing/installing the bridge. A 5- to 6-foot wide by 25- to 30-foot long steel I-
beam bridge with railings would be constructed to support the new trail section across the 
seasonal stream along the new motorized trail alignment. DNR would determine the 
ordinary high water (OHW) of the stream (if one exists) and the boundaries of any 
associated wetlands that are identified during its wetland investigation. The bridge 
clearance above the stream is anticipated to be approximately 5–6 feet, but no less than at 
least 4 ½ feet. The bridge abutments/approaches would be located outside of the stream 
OHW and any associated wetlands that are identified. Depending on site conditions, the 
goal is to approach the bridge at a slightly uphill grade to ensure no sediment enters the 
stream from the trail. The bridge approaches would be constructed with modern pressure-
treated wood and wrapped in geo-textile fabric to minimize erosion. If the grade of the 
bridge approaches is between 6 and 10 percent, a combination of concrete building blocks 
and crushed rock would be used. If the grade of the bridge approaches is less than 6 
percent, only crushed rock would be used.

*	Abandoning and rehabilitating the trail alignment. Approximately 0.5 mile of the 
original Mount Molly Loop Trail that was not destroyed in the 2007 landslides and that 
would be bypassed by the new route would be abandoned and rehabilitated. This would 
involve removing any built structures, loosening the trail surface soils with a mini-
excavator, softening the slope of the abandoned trail to blend into the surrounding 
landscape, and planting native vegetation, such as salal (Gaultheria shallon) and 
swordfern (Polystichum munitum). Woody debris would be pulled across the abandoned 
trail at the access points and along the trail to block access and discourage unauthorized 
use. The damaged sections of trail covered or destroyed by the landslides would not be 
rehabilitated. 

Construction of the project is anticipated to take approximately 2–3 months using a 4-person 
crew with an additional crew member present to load surfacing rock for transport by ATV/trailer 
units. The project would be constructed by DNR staff, or a combination of DNR staff and 
Washington Conservation Corps (WCC) crew or Department of Corrections (DOC) labor under 
close supervision. Project construction would be scheduled to avoid wet soil conditions, and 
would probably occur during the late spring, summer, or early fall.
DNR would adhere to federal, state, and county regulations, permit conditions, and BMPs for 
the design, construction, and long-term maintenance of the proposed project, including, but not 
limited to: 

*	Trail Design and Construction: Trail design and construction would be in accordance 
with the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) ORV trail standards (USFS 1991). 

*	Stream and Wetland Protection: The project alignment crosses a small (less than 2-foot) 
wide), seasonal, non-fish bearing stream (described in detail in Section 3.2, Hydrology, 
Water Quality, Floodplains, and Wetlands). Vegetation observed within and around the 
stream during a September 2010 site visit included three species that are known to occur 
both in wetlands and in uplands (in moist to wet, shady forest conditions) (described in 
detail in Section 3.3, Vegetation). One obligate wetland sedge species was also observed 
in or near the stream by a FEMA Wetland Scientist during the site visit. However, a 
complete wetland investigation, which would include a comprehensive field investigation 
of vegetation, soils, and hydrologic conditions to determine whether conditions at the site 
meet wetland definition criteria, was not conducted as part of the September 2010 site 
visit. Given the presence of some wetland associated plants in the stream vicinity, it is 
possible that wetland conditions occur as a wetland fringe along the stream channel in the 
vicinity of the project alignment. DNR will conduct a wetland investigation in the 
vicinity of the project alignment crossing through the stream drainage to determine 
whether wetlands are present and, if so, to determine the wetland boundary.

*	Installing Temporary Erosion Control: Silt fencing would be installed around the 
stream and associated wetlands (if present) in the vicinity of the project alignment prior to 
construction of the bridge approaches and bridge and before any ground-disturbing 
activities are conducted in the area. Straw would be placed over disturbed and exposed 
soils around the stream and any associated wetlands after construction to minimize 
potential erosion and sedimentation until soils are stabilized.


*	Vegetation Clearing and Grubbing: These specifications direct clearing operations, 
including removing, preserving, and trimming trees and other vegetation. They also 
address grubbing operations (i.e., removing roots) and limit the area of approved actions. 
These specifications protect vegetation both inside and outside approved work areas. 
Vegetation clearing and ground disturbance for the proposed project would be limited to 
that essential for the project and would be in accordance with the USFS ORV trail 
standards (USFS 1991). Vegetation would be cleared to 4 feet wide for the trail travel 
surface and brushed beyond the trail to 6 feet wide and 8 feet high. Trail alignment 
would be field determined to avoid trees to the extent possible. Any trees removed for 
the project would be no larger than 5 inches dbh.

*	Water Quality, Erosion, and Sediment Control: These specifications require the 
implementation of a Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control (TESC) Plan to comply 
with federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Erosion and sediment control 
specifications typically focus on soil and slope protection and stabilization measures, 
followed by site restoration methods (including planting materials). TESC BMPs for the 
proposed trail project would involve installing silt fencing on both sides of the trail in the 
vicinity of the stream crossing prior to the start of ground disturbance in that area and 
prior to construction of the bridge approaches and bridge structure. Straw mulch would 
be place over disturbed and exposed soils around the stream after construction until soils 
are stabilized.

*	Environmental Protection: These specifications require compliance with laws and 
regulations designed to protect sensitive environmental resources. To ensure that all 
construction-related pollutants are controlled and contained, a project-specific Spill 
Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan would be developed and 
implemented. These specifications addresses hazardous waste and hazardous substances 
management, pollution control, protection of plant and animal species, protection of 
wetlands, and protection of cultural resources, as well as other applicable safety, health, 
and human resource issues.


2.4 SUMMARY OF EFFECTS

Table 2.4-1 summarizes the effects described and analyzed in Chapter 3 (Affected Environment 
and Environmental Consequences). Levels of potential effect are defined as follows:

*	None/Negligible: The resource area would not be affected, or changes would be non-
detectable or, if detected, effects would be slight and local. Impacts would be well below 
regulatory limits.
*	Minor: Changes to the resource would be measurable, although the changes would be 
small and localized. Impacts would be within or below regulatory limits. Mitigation 
measures may be necessary to reduce potential effects.
*	Moderate: Changes to the resource would be measurable and have localized and 
potentially regional scale impacts. Impacts would be within or below regulatory limits, but 
historical conditions would be altered. Mitigation measures may be necessary to reduce 
potential effects.
*	Major: Changes would be readily measurable and would have substantial consequences 
on a local and/or regional level. Impacts would exceed regulatory limits. Mitigation 
measures to offset the effects would be required to reduce impacts, although long-term 
changes to the resource would be possible.
The criteria and thresholds of significance used in the analysis are defined by resource in 
Chapter 3.

3.0 Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

The following sections describe the affected environment (including regulatory considerations) 
and environmental consequences of the Proposed Action on physical, biological, recreational, 
visual, and cultural resources in the project area. The level of detail for each resource topic is 
commensurate with the scale and context of the proposed project and the potential impacts of the 
project alternatives on that resource. As described in Chapter 1, certain resource topics are not 
evaluated in detail because the project alternatives would have no effect on those resources or 
effects are known and minimal. These include land use, socioeconomics, transportation, and air 
quality. Access in the context of the proposed project is related to recreation and is addressed in 
Section 3.5, Recreation and Visual Resources. Noise within the context of the proposed project is 
addressed in Section 3.4, Fish and Wildlife.
 
3.1 GEOLOGY, SOILS, AND SLOPE STABILITY
This section describes the existing condition of the physical landscape in the project vicinity, 
including geology, soils, and slope stability, with additional information on topography and 
landforms as applicable, and describes the potential effects of the project alternatives on these 
resources.
3.1.1 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

The project is located near Larch Mountain in the Capitol Forest (see Figure 1.1-1, Project 
Location). The Capitol Forest is located in part of a low-lying mountain range along the western 
boundary of Thurston County known as the Black Hills (DNR 2005). The Black Hills are within 
the Willapa Hills physiogeographic province and are part of the Coast Range (Lasmanis 1991). 
Mountains in the Black Hills are mainly rounded peaks and ridges of basalt (SCS 1990). They 
include Capitol Peak, Fuzzy Top, Rock Candy, and Larch Mountain. The elevation of the Capitol 
Forest ranges from 200 feet along the Chehalis River up to its highest point atop Larch Mountain 
at 2,660 feet (DNR 2005).

The proposed project alignment traverses a ridge running approximately north-south between 
Larch Mountain and Rock Candy Mountain for approximately 0.46 mile, and then switches back 
down the east face of the slope within the Potosi Creek drainage for approximately 0.41 mile (see 
Figure 1.1-1, Project Location). The ridge between Larch Mountain and Rock Candy Mountain 
separates the Waddell Creek drainage (to the east) from the North Fork Porter Creek drainage (to 
the west). The Potosi Creek drainage is one of several small and steep headwater drainages on 
this east-facing slope that form Waddell Creek. Along the ridge, the proposed project alignment 
begins at an elevation of approximately 1,710 feet (above mean sea level), and rises to a 
maximum elevation of approximately 2,010 feet. The proposed project alignment then drops 
down the eastern face of the slope within the Potosi Creek drainage to approximately 1,790 feet 
in elevation where it intersects the remaining portion of the C-4500 Road. The damaged trail 
sections are located along the C-4500 Road to the east, on steep slopes (greater than 50 percent) 
in the Potosi Creek drainage, and at elevations of approximately 1,700 and 1,800 feet. 

While clay-based soils are inherent throughout much of the Capitol State Forest (DNR 2005), 
soils in the project area are mapped as Katula very cobbly loam (NRCS 2009). These soil types 
are found on narrow ridgetops and back slopes in upland areas in the project vicinity. Depth to 
lithic bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches (NRCS 2009; SCS 1990). Both of these soils types are 
considered to be well drained (NRCS 2009). Permeability is moderate in the Katula soil (SCS 
1990). On 20–30 percent slopes, runoff is slow and water erosion hazard is slight on Katula soils 
(SCS 1990). On 30–65 percent slopes, runoff and water erosion hazard are medium (SCS 1990).

Debris slides, avalanches, and debris flows occurred in the Potosi Creek drainage as a result of 
the December 3, 2007 storm event, including the slope failures that damaged the motorized trail 
sections to be replaced by this project (see Figure 3.1-1, Recent Landslides in the Potosi Creek 
Drainage). The December 3, 2007 debris slides and avalanches originated high in the watershed, 
between approximately 1,700 and 1,800 feet in elevation, on steep (40–50 percent) slopes in the 
upper reaches of small, seasonal streams that drain the slope and flow into Potosi Creek. Debris 
flows occurred lower in the drainage along both stream channels and along the entire length of 
Potosi Creek up to its confluence with Waddell Creek (DNR 2010a).

3.1.1.1 Regulatory Context

No specific regulations or requirements directly target geology, soils, or slope stability within the 
Capitol Forest.

3.1.2 METHODOLOGY AND THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

The potential effects of the project alternatives on geology, soils, and slope stability were 
evaluated in terms of ecological context and intensity. AECOM ecologists gathered and 
reviewed available information regarding geologic hazards and soils in the project vicinity 
(primarily within the Potosi Creek drainage area), and conducted a site visit on September 29, 
2010 to collect information on general site conditions along the proposed project alignment. 
Direct impacts on soil resources were quantified, while the potential indirect impacts of the 
project alternatives were qualitatively identified based on best professional judgment.
Based on the location of the proposed project alignment along a ridgetop and steep side slope 
with seasonal stream drainages, past landslide activity, and recreational uses, a project alternative 
was determined to result in a significant effect on geology, soils, or slope stability if it would:

*	Present a substantial risk to people or property due to geologic hazards such as landslides.
*	Cause substantial long-term erosion of soils.
*	Result in a substantial accumulation of sediment in downstream aquatic habitats.

3.1.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

This section describes the potential effects of the project alternatives on geology, soils, and slope 
stability in the project area. Measures to avoid, reduce, or mitigate for any identified impacts on 
recreational and visual resources are also identified.

Alternative A (No Action)

Under the No Action Alternative, FEMA would not provide funds to support DNR in rerouting 
the Mount Molly Loop Trail to bypass above the December 2007 landslides that damaged 
sections of two motorized recreation trails in that area. Without FEMA funding, DNR would not 
construct the proposed trail reroute or rehabilitate the intact sections of trail leading to the 
landslide area. 

Under the No Action Alternative, no ground-disturbing activities would occur along the 
proposed project alignment or the closed trails. Since the compacted surface soils on the closed 
trails would not be loosened and the slopes softened to blend into the surrounding landscape, 
some erosion potential would remain. However, understory shrubs that were previously brushed 
back from the trail travel way would grow back relatively quickly (within approximately 1–2 
years) and would intercept some precipitation, reducing erosion potential in the near term. 
Species, such as red alder (Alnus rubra), that successfully establish themselves in disturbed and 
compacted soils would also begin to grow within the trail travel way relatively quickly (within 
approximately 1–5 years), further reducing erosion potential as they mature and intercept more 
precipitation. Over time, forest litter (leaves, needles, twigs, etc.) would accumulate, and along 
with natural forest soils processes, would encourage the growth of other vegetation, eventually 
reducing erosion potential on the closed trail to levels similar to adjacent areas. 

The No Action Alternative would have no effect on local geology and would have a negligible 
adverse effect on soils and slope stability.

Alternative B (Proposed Action)

Under the Proposed Action Alternative, FEMA would provide funds to support DNR in 
rerouting the Mount Molly Mount Molly Loop Trail to bypass above the December 2007 
landslides that damaged sections of two motorized recreation trails in that area.

Roughly 0.5 acre of soil would be disturbed during construction of the proposed trail reroute. 
Soil along the trail travel way would be permanently compacted and would be hardened in some 
areas with crushed rock. Trail design and construction, erosion and sediment control BMPs 
described in Section 2.3 (Alternative B – Proposed Action), and ongoing trail maintenance 
practices would reduce soil erosion during construction and operation of the project to negligible 
levels.

DNR has completed a preliminary field determination of the proposed project alignment. The 
trail reroute would follow the ridge line for approximately 0.46 mile where there is little to no risk 
to slope stability. The trail reroute would then switch back down the east slope of the ridge, 
where it would follow relatively flat to low-gradient (0–5 percent) natural benches in the slope 
along much of the route. The steepest gradients occur in the last quarter mile of the route, 
including switchbacks, where slopes are estimated to range between 10 and 30 percent. The 
December 2007 landslides in the Potosi Creek drainage originate on steeper slopes (50 percent 
and greater) lower in the drainage. 

The location of the proposed trail reroute on lower gradient slopes high up in the drainage, away 
from all but the uppermost reach of one small undefined seasonal stream drainage, along with 
adherence to USFS ORV trail design standards and drainage control structures, would have a 
negligible effect on slope stability and present a negligible risk to people or property from 
landslides.

Permanent closure of the trail sections to be bypassed with the proposed project alignment, 
softening the slope to blend into the surrounding slope, and planting native vegetation (primarily 
swordfern and salal) along the closed trail would reduce erosion potential in that area to 
negligible levels.

Overall, the Proposed Action would have a negligible adverse effect on soils and slope stability 
in the Potosi Creek drainage.

Mitigation Measures

The No Action and Proposed Action alternatives would have no effect on local geology and 
would have negligible adverse effects on soils and slope stability. The Proposed Action 
incorporates avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures into the project design and 
implementation and would adhere to the BMPs listed in Section 2.3. No additional mitigation 
measures are proposed for geology, soils, and slope stability.

Significant Unavoidable Adverse Effects

The No Action and Proposed Action alternatives would have no significant effects on geology, 
soils, or slope stability.


3.2 HYDROLOGY, WATER QUALITY, FLOODPLAINS, AND WETLANDS

This section describes hydrology, water quality, floodplains, and wetlands in the project vicinity, 
and the potential effects of the project alternatives on these resources. 

3.2.1 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

Watershed Setting and Hydrology

The project vicinity is located in the Upper Chehalis Water Resource Inventory Area (WRIA) 23, 
near a north-south ridgeline. The project area is in the Waddell Creek basin (6th field Hydrologic 
Unit Code [HUC] 171001030505) within the greater Black River watershed. Total annual 
precipitation for the area is about 51 inches (SCS 1990) and is the major source of water, both 
surface and subsurface flow, in the project vicinity. The Waddell Creek basin (11,380 acres) 
includes several steep, relatively straight, headwater creeks including: Sunbeam Creek, Potosi 
Creek, Camp Four Creek, and Noski Creek. However, the damaged sites and proposed trail 
alignment are near the top of the ridgeline, and only a small unnamed headwater tributary 
(project area tributary) to Potosi Creek is present along the proposed alignment (Figure 3.1-1). 
Although the upper reach of Potosi Creek has an average gradient of 12 to 20 percent (WDFW 
2011), the proposed location of the bridge over the project area tributary has a much lower 
gradient, suitable for the proposed trail crossing. The narrow project area tributary has seasonal 
flow; it was observed as dry during the summer by DNR, and had 2 inches of water in small step 
pools during the site visit on September 29, 2010. 

Forest Practices Application and Review System mapping indicates that the project area tributary 
is a Type N water that does not meet the physical criteria to be potentially used by fish (DNR 
2011). Type N (formerly type 4 or 5) waters make up approximately 90 percent of the stream 
network on DNR-managed forest lands (DNR 1997c). These streams (including the project area 
tributary) are major links between hillslopes and fish-bearing streams (DNR 1997c, Pitlick and 
Wilcock 2001). These links enhance aquatic environments downstream by providing areas for 
sorting sediment and delivering stream substrate (Pitlick and Wilcock 2001). 

Water Quality

Washington's Water Quality Assessment lists the status of water quality for a particular location 
in one of five categories recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and 
Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). Administered in Washington state by the 
Department of Ecology (Ecology), the 303(d) list reports on Category 5 waters, which are 
impaired waters of the state. Waters placed on the 303(d) list require the preparation of a plan to 
improve water quality by limiting pollutant loads. No waters in the project area are 303(d) listed 
as an impaired water of the state (Ecology 2008a). 
Waddell Creek is one of the sites with the highest mean turbidity in the WRIA 23 and is 
considered sediment rich (Green et al. 2009). Turbidity tends to be highest during the winter, 
particularly after storms and flood events, and lowest during the summer (Green et al. 2009). As 
described in Section 3.1 (Geology, Soils, and Slope Stability), the damaged sites are actively 
eroding and delivering more sediment to headwater stream channels that are already sediment 
rich.

Floodplains

The project is not located within a floodplain (FEMA 1982). FEMA regulations define a 
floodplain as “the lowland and relatively flat areas adjoining inland and coastal waters including, 
at a minimum, that area subject to a 1 percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year” 
(44 CFR 9.4). The project location is mapped on the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) 
for Thurston County, Washington (unincorporated areas) (Community Panel Numbers 
5301880275C and 5301880250C) as “Zone C” (FEMA 1982). These are areas of minimal flood 
hazard.

Wetlands

Information was gathered from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) National Wetlands 
Inventory (NWI) maps (USFWS 2011a, WDFW 2010) and the DNR Forest Practices 
Application Review System (DNR 2011); these sources showed no wetlands in the project area. 
The closest wetlands are mapped approximately 1.5 miles east of the project area near the 
confluence of Potosi Creek and Waddell Creek (Figure 3.1-1). As described in Section 3.1 
(Geology, Soils, and Slope Stability), clay-based soils are inherent throughout much of the Capitol 
Forest (DNR 2005); however, soils in the project area are mapped as Katula very cobbly loam 
(NRCS 2009). In general, the Katula series consists of deep, well-drained soils with a low water 
capacity on uplands formed from weathered basalt (SCS 1990). The Katula soil series is not 
listed as hydric on the national (NRCS 2011a) or Thurston County hydric soil lists (NRCS 
2011b).

As described in more detail in Section 3.3 (Vegetation), vegetation along the project alignment is 
primarily Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest with a narrow corridor of red alder that is 
associated with the unnamed tributary. Piggyback plant (Tolmiea menziesii), blue wildrye 
(Elymus glaucus), lady fern (Athryium felix-femina), and inside-out flower (Vancouveria 
hexandra) were observed within and along the small, undefined stream channel. One obligate 
wetland species was also observed in the stream vicinity by a FEMA Wetland Scientist during 
the site visit. These plant species are known to occur in both wetland and upland areas and are 
typical of forest sloped areas that retain surface water for a few days after rain events with moist 
to wet conditions. Small areas of ponded water were observed in the unnamed project tributary 
but not in adjacent areas.

As described in more detail in Section 2.3 (Alternative B - Proposed Action), a complete wetland 
investigation, which would include a comprehensive field investigation of vegetation, soils, and 
hydrologic conditions to determine whether conditions at the site meet wetland definition 
criteria, was not conducted as part of the September 2010 site visit. Given the presence of some 
wetland associated plants in the stream vicinity, it is possible that wetland conditions occur as a 
wetland fringe along the stream channel in the vicinity of the project alignment. DNR will 
conduct a wetland investigation in the vicinity of the project alignment crossing through the 
stream drainage to determine whether wetlands are present and, if so, to determine the wetland 
boundary.

3.2.1.1 Regulatory Context

Federal, state, and local regulations addressing hydrology, water quality, floodplains, and 
wetlands in the affected environment are summarized below.

Federal Requirements

Clean Water Act (Sections 401 and 404)

Projects funded by FEMA must comply with permit requirements for the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers (Corps) under the CWA. Actions affecting waters of the United States (waters of the 
U.S.) and that involve the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S., including 
wetlands, are regulated by Section 404 of the CWA. Section 401 of the CWA, administered by 
Ecology, requires that activities permitted under Section 404 meet state water quality standards. 
DNR manages its forest landscapes, including the Capitol State Forest, under the guidance of the 
State Trust Lands Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) (DNR 1997c). This multi-species HCP was 
developed to address state trust land management issues related to compliance with the federal 
Endangered Species Act (16 United States Code [U.S.C.] 1531 et seq.). The HCP is a 
partnership among the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the USFWS, and DNR, and 
guides the management of approximately 1.8 million acres of forested state trust lands within the 
range of the northern spotted owl. The HCP includes a riparian conservation strategy that defines 
a riparian management zone and riparian buffers for different stream types, and the types of 
activities that can occur in these areas. Implementation of BMPs in accordance with the HCP 
would meet or exceed CWA standards (pers. comm., Mettler 2011).

Executive Orders 11988 (Floodplain Management) and 11990 (Protection of Wetlands)

EO 11988 (Floodplains) requires federal agencies to reduce the risk of flood loss; minimize the 
impact on human health, safety, and welfare; and restore the natural and beneficial values served 
by floodplains. Under FEMA’s implementing regulations at 44 CFR Part 9, FEMA must evaluate 
the potential effects of any actions it may take in a floodplain and consider alternatives to avoid 
adverse effects. Similarly, EO 11990 (Wetlands) requires that federal agencies take action to 
minimize the destruction, loss, or degradation of wetlands, and to preserve and enhance the 
natural and beneficial effects of wetlands. In planning their actions, federal agencies are required 
to consider alternatives to wetland sites and limit potential damage if an activity affecting a 
wetland cannot be avoided. Federal agencies are also required under 44 CFR Part 9 to provide 
public notice and review of plans for actions in floodplains and wetlands. The public notice for 
this disaster and public review of the Draft EA meet FEMA’s public notice and review 
obligations. As described below in Section 3.2.2 (Environmental Consequences), the Proposed 
Action would not affect wetlands or floodplains.

Coastal Zone Management Act

Federal activities or projects proposed within any of Washington's 15 coastal counties (including 
Thurston County) must be consistent with the policies of Washington’s coastal zone management 
program. DNR is responsible for obtaining a federal consistency determination from Ecology and 
providing this determination to FEMA. 

3.2.2 METHODOLOGY AND THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE 

The potential effects of the project alternatives on hydrology, water quality, floodplains, and 
wetlands in the project area were evaluated in terms of both regulatory considerations and 
ecological context and intensity. This was determined by gathering and reviewing information 
regarding rivers and streams, wetlands, floodplains, and water quality conditions in the project 
area; determining which of these resources are present in areas potentially affected by the project 
alternatives; and evaluating how the project alternatives could impact resources present in the 
affected environment based on the known effects of similar projects from available literature 
sources and best professional judgment.

The presence or absence of wetlands was determined in accordance with CFR 44 Part 9.4, which 
defines wetlands as those areas inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater with a 
frequency sufficient to support, or that under normal hydrologic conditions do or would support, 
a prevalence of vegetation or aquatic life typically adapted for life in saturated or seasonally 
saturated soil conditions. This definition is intended to be consistent with the definition of 
wetlands in Cowardin et al. (1979) (44 CFR 9.4). In Washington state, the Corps Wetland 
Delineation Manual (Environmental Laboratory 1987) and Regional Supplement (Environmental 
Laboratory 2010) are the field methods used to evaluate whether hydrologic, vegetation, and 
soils conditions meet the definition of a wetland as in 44 CFR 9.4. 

It was determined that the potentially affected environment for the Proposed Action is limited to 
hydrology, water quality, and potential wetlands; no floodplains are present in the project 
vicinity. The project alternatives were determined to have a significant effect on hydrology, 
water quality, or wetlands if they would: 

*	Violate water quality standards or cause prolonged alteration to baseline water quality 
conditions. 
*	Alter the existing drainage pattern of streams or wetlands in a manner that would violate 
or exceed the standards of any required permits.
*	Cause adverse effects on wetlands that are not minimized in accordance with FEMA’s 
standards in 44 CFR 9.11.
*	Violate any local, state, or federal regulations concerning hydrology, water quality, 
wetlands, or floodplains.

3.2.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES 

This section describes the potential effects of the project alternatives on hydrology, water quality, 
and wetlands within the affected environment. Measures to avoid, reduce, or mitigate any 
identified impacts on these resources are also identified.

Alternative A (No Action)

Under the No Action Alternative, as described in Section 2.2 (Alternative A - No Action), FEMA 
would not provide funds to DNR for the Proposed Action. Without FEMA funding, DNR 
would not construct the proposed trail reroute or rehabilitate the intact sections of the original 
trail leading to the landslide area that are permanently closed to recreational use.

Under the No Action Alternative, no ground-disturbing activities would occur along the 
proposed project alignment or the closed trails. As described in Section 3.1 (Geology, Soils, and 
Slope Stability), without rehabilitation of the closed trails, the compacted surface soils in those 
areas are expected to contribute to some erosion potential in the near term, although it is expected 
to be negligible. Natural regrowth and reestablishment of vegetation, and the accumulation of 
forest litter, is expected to reduce erosion potential along the closed trails even further within 
approximately 1–5 years. While most soil erosion would be intercepted by the immediately 
surrounding landscape, the steep slopes could contribute to the transport of some materials 
farther downslope. Any erosion-related delivery of sediments to aquatic resources downslope of 
the closed trails and associated effects on hydrology, water quality, or wetlands are expected to 
be negligible. 

Alternative B (Proposed Action)

Under the Proposed Action, FEMA would provide funds to DNR for construction of 
approximately 1 mile of new motorized recreation trail, including one bridge, and the 
abandonment and rehabilitation of approximately 0.5 mile of trail not damaged in the landslide 
that would be bypassed by the new route (as described in Section 2.3, Alternative B - Proposed 
Action). 

As described in more detail in Section 2.3 (Alternative B - Proposed Action), a complete wetland 
investigation was not conducted as part of the September 2010 site visit. DNR will conduct a 
wetland investigation in the vicinity of the project alignment crossing through the stream 
drainage to determine whether wetlands are present and, if so, DNR will also determine the 
wetland boundary. If wetlands are present, DNR will avoid impacts on wetland resources; 
therefore, there will be no net loss of wetland function.

Effects on water quality and hydrology in the unnamed tributary would be limited to 
construction-related activities. Construction-related activities for the bridge would occur during 
the summer when little or no water would be in the creek channel. The bridge would also be built 
outside and above the project tributary and potentially present wetlands and be designed to 
accommodate natural hydrologic and sedimentation processes typical of these high gradient 
headwaters. Construction-related activities from trail and bridge construction would disturb soils 
and alter surface runoff and sheet flow. In addition, temporary and permanent erosion control 
BMPs would ensure that construction and operation of the Proposed Action would be limited to 
negligible short- and long-term impacts on hydrology and water quality. 

Mitigation Measures

The Proposed Action incorporates avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures into the 
project design and implementation and would adhere to water quality BMPs in accordance with 
the HCP. No additional mitigation measures are proposed for hydrology and water quality.

Significant Unavoidable Adverse Effects

No significant unavoidable effects on hydrology, water quality, floodplains, or wetlands are 
anticipated from either of the alternatives.


3.3 VEGETATION

This section describes vegetation communities and special status plant species in the project 
vicinity, and the potential effects of the project alternatives on these resources.

3.3.1 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

Vegetation Communities

The project is located in the Capitol Forest, a 91,650-acre “working forest” southwest of Olympia 
in Thurston and Grays Harbor counties. The Capitol Forest is both a timber-producing forest and 
a popular recreation destination. The forest is managed by the DNR Pacific Cascade Region for 
timber production, wildlife habitat, and recreation and public access. 

The project is located in previously harvested, second-growth, Douglas-fir forest that was 
commercially thinned in 1995 (FEMA 2010). The understory consists primarily of Douglas-fir 
saplings, red huckleberry (Vaccinium parvifolium), swordfern, salal, and Oregon grape (Mahonia 
sp.); all upland species. The overstory transitions to red alder where the proposed project 
alignment crosses the small seasonal stream drainage described in Section 3.2 (Hydrology, Water 
Quality, Floodplains, and Wetlands). The understory is similar within this drainage, except within 
and along the narrow, undefined stream channel. Several herbaceous plants often found in moist 
to wet, shady forest conditions were observed in this area during the September 2010 site visit. 
The predominant plant observed along the stream channel was piggyback plant. Others included 
blue wildrye (Elymus glaucus), lady fern, and inside-out flower (Vancouveria hexandra). 
Piggyback plant and lady fern are sometimes found in wetlands, while blue wildrye and inside-
out flower are upland plants. The FEMA Wetland Scientist present during the September 2010 
site visit also observed a sedge species in the vicinity of the stream. The species was not 
identified at the time, but it is thought to have been an obligate wetland species. Wetlands are 
described in detail in Section 3.2 (Hydrology, Water Quality, Floodplains, and Wetlands). 
Invasive species are not a major component of vegetation communities in the project vicinity, and 
none were observed along the proposed project alignment during the September 2010 site visit 
(see Figure 3.3-1, Photos of Representative Vegetation). 

Special Status Plants and Rare Ecological Communities

In this EA, special status plant species are defined as plants that are federally listed as either 
listed or proposed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), or that 
are otherwise considered sensitive by state resource conservation agencies. 
Two plants listed under the ESA occur in Thurston County: golden paintbrush (Castilleja 
levisecta) and water howellia (Howellia aquatilis) (USFWS 2010). DNR maintains the 
Washington Natural Heritage Program (WNHP), a database of current and historic locations of 
ESA-listed and sensitive plant species in Washington. 
 

Figure 3.3-1. Photos of Representative Vegetation.
[insert figure of photos of vegetation communitiesin the project area, including Douglas-fir
forest, understory, and streamside vegetation]

Neither golden paintbrush nor water howellia are documented by WNHP within the Potosi Creek 
drainage or within the surrounding headwater drainages that form Waddell Creek (DNR 2010b). 
Golden paintbrush is found in open grasslands in the Puget Trough lowlands (DNR 1997a); in 
western Washington, water howellia is found in low elevation wetlands (DNR 1997b). Habitat 
conditions in the project vicinity are not suitable for either of these species.

3.3.1.1 Regulatory Context

Federal, state, and local regulations addressing vegetation are summarized below. While no ESA-
listed plants occur in the project vicinity, regulatory considerations pertaining to the ESA are 
summarized along with a brief explanation of why no further actions are needed to meet 
regulatory requirements.

Endangered Species Act

The ESA serves as the primary federal protection for species and habitat, by providing a formal 
designation and implementing programs through which the conservation of both populations and 
habitats may be achieved. Two agencies are responsible for the administration of the ESA: the 
USFWS and NMFS. The USFWS is responsible for plants under the ESA. Because no ESA-
listed plants or suitable habitat for ESA-listed plants that occur in Thurston County are present in 
the project vicinity (USFWS 2010; DNR 1997a, 1997b, 2010b), no further action is required by 
FEMA under the ESA for listed plants.

Executive Order 13112 – Invasive Species

EO 13112 requires federal agencies to prevent the introduction of invasive species, provide for 
their control, and minimize the economic, ecological, and human health effects that invasive 
species cause. In accordance with the Environmental Protection BMPs described in Section 2.3 
(Proposed Action), DNR would implement its standard BMPs for preventing the spread of 
invasive species in the Capitol Forest. No further action is required by FEMA under EO 13112.

3.3.2 METHODOLOGY AND THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

The potential effects of the project alternatives on vegetation were evaluated in terms of both 
regulatory considerations and ecological context and intensity. AECOM ecologists gathered and 
reviewed available information regarding special status plants and rare ecological communities 
documented in Thurston County and the project vicinity (primarily the Waddell Creek and 
surrounding drainages), and conducted a site visit on September 29, 2010 to collect information 
on general site conditions, vegetation communities, and special habitat features (e.g., wetlands, 
suitable habitat for special status plants) along the proposed project alignment. The vegetation 
resources present in areas that could potentially be affected by the project alternatives were 
identified. Direct impacts of the project alternatives on vegetation resources were quantified, 
while potential indirect impacts of the project alternatives were qualitatively identified based on 
best professional judgment. 

A project alternative was determined to have a significant effect on vegetation if it would: 

*	Substantially disturb or degrade sensitive natural communities, such as riparian or wetland 
habitats.
*	Directly or indirectly alter sensitive, threatened, or endangered plants or their habitat.
*	Conflict with applicable federal, state, or local regulations. 

3.3.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

This section describes the potential effects of the project alternatives on vegetation resources in 
the project area. Measures to avoid, reduce, or mitigate any identified impacts on these resources 
are also identified.

Alternative A (No Action)

Under the No Action Alternative, FEMA would not provide funds to support DNR in rerouting 
the Mount Molly Loop Trail to bypass above the December 2007 landslides. Without FEMA 
funding, DNR would not construct the proposed trail reroute or rehabilitate the intact sections of 
the trail leading to the landslide area.

Under the No Action Alternative, no vegetation clearing would occur along the proposed project 
alignment and no vegetation would be planted along the closed trails. The intact sections of the 
Mount Molly Loop Trail leading to the areas damaged in the December 2007 landslides would 
remain permanently closed to all recreation uses. Understory shrubs that were previously brushed 
back from the trail travel way, and species such as red alder that successfully establish in 
disturbed and compacted soils, would grow over and within the closed trail relatively quickly 
(approximately 1–5 years). Over time, forest litter (leaves, needles, twigs, etc.) would 
accumulate, and along with natural forest soils processes, would encourage the growth of other 
vegetation. However, it could take many years for plants such as red huckleberry, swordfern, 
salal, and Oregon grape, common in the surrounding landscape, to re-establish on the closed trail.
 
The No Action Alternative would have a negligible adverse effect on vegetation.

Alternative B (Proposed Action)

Under the Proposed Action Alternative, FEMA would provide funds to support DNR in 
rerouting the Mount Molly Mount Molly Loop Trail to bypass above the December 2007 
landslides.

Approximately 0.5 acre of relatively dense understory vegetation, consisting primarily of 
swordfern, salal, and Oregon grape, would be permanently cleared during construction of the 
proposed trail reroute. Some red huckleberry and small trees may also be removed. However, the 
final trail alignment would be routed to avoid the removal of any mature trees. Understory shrubs 
would be brushed back as necessary (as described in Section 2.3, Alternative B – Proposed 
Action) both during construction of the proposed trail reroute and as a long-term maintenance 
activity. Vegetation along the small, undefined stream channel would be avoided during 
construction of the trail bridge to the extent possible. However, it is probable that some trampling 
of vegetation would occur in this area during bridge construction.

Compacted soils would be loosened, trail structures removed, and native plants, primarily 
swordfern and salal, would be planted along approximately 0.5 mile of the Mount Molly Loop 
that would be bypassed by the proposed trail reroute. Vegetation previously brushed back during 
ongoing trail maintenance activities has grown, and would continue to grow, back quickly 
(approximately 1–2 years). Other native species, such as red alder, would begin to self-establish 
relatively quickly (approximately 1–5 years). The loosened soils, accumulation of forest litter, and 
natural forest soils processes would encourage the spread of other, slower growing plants that are 
common in the surrounding forest over time. 

The plant species that would be removed for the proposed trail reroute are common and 
widespread understory species in both conifer and mixed conifer-hardwood communities within 
the Capitol Forest and throughout western Washington. The herbaceous plant species observed 
along the project area stream channel are also common and widespread in moist to wet, shady 
forest conditions throughout western Washington. The rehabilitation, including planting of 
swordfern and salal, along 0.5 mile of the closed and bypassed Mount Molly Loop Trail, would 
partially offset the vegetation removal associated with the proposed trail reroute. However, there 
would still be some net loss. This loss would be a minor adverse effect on vegetation locally or 
regionally, and would have no effect on any rare, unique, wetland, or otherwise protected plant 
species or communities.

Mitigation Measures

The No Action and Proposed Action alternatives would both have negligible adverse effects on 
vegetation that is common and widespread both locally and regionally, and no effect on any rare, 
unique, wetland, or otherwise protected plant species or communities. The Proposed Action 
incorporates avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures into the project design and 
implementation and would adhere to the BMPs listed in Section 2.3. No additional mitigation 
measures are proposed for vegetation. 

Significant Unavoidable Adverse Effects

The No Action and Proposed Action alternatives would have no significant effects on 
vegetation.


3.4 FISH AND WILDLIFE

This section describes fish and wildlife resources in the project vicinity and the potential effects 
of project alternatives on these resources. No federally listed threatened or endangered species or 
suitable habitats are documented in the project area (NMFS 2011; USFWS 2011b; WDFW 2010, 
2011).

3.4.1 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT 

Fish 

As described in Section 3.2 (Hydrology, Water Quality, Floodplains, and Wetlands), the project 
area includes an unnamed tributary to Potosi Creek with seasonal flow that does not have 
suitable habitat to support fish species (DNR 2011). A search of the Washington Department of 
Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) Priority Habitats and Species (PHS) database (WDFW 2010) and 
SalmonScape (WDFW 2011) for the project area indicated no fish presence in the project area 
tributary. The closest fish occurrence data indicated fish presence 2,000 feet downstream in 
Potosi Creek, outside of the project area, where coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki 
clarki) is present (WDFW 2010, 2011).

Information on special-status fish species and priority habitats potentially occurring in the project 
area was obtained from NMFS (NMFS 2011), USFWS (USFWS 2011b), WDFW PHS (WDFW 
2010), and SalmonScape (WDFW 2011). No federally listed threatened or endangered species or 
suitable habitat is present in the project area. The closest special status fish species data indicate 
fish presence 5,800 feet downstream in Potosi Creek outside of the project area and includes the 
historical presence of Southwest Washington (SW) Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) coho 
salmon (O. kisutch), a state candidate species (WDFW 2010). NMFS has determined that the SW 
ESU coho salmon does not warrant listing as federally threatened or endangered under the ESA 
(NMFS 2011).

Wildlife 

As described in Section 3.3 (Vegetation), the project vicinity is primarily fragmented Douglas-fir 
forest and upland riparian areas associated with the project area tributary. These wildlife habitats 
include areas for nesting and foraging, cover, and connectivity to the larger Waddell Creek 
watershed and patches of mature forest. Common wildlife species in the project vicinity include 
winter wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), American robin (Turdus migratorius), and dark-eyed junco 
(Junco hyemalis). Other wildlife species include black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus 
columbianus).
 
Information on special-status wildlife species and priority habitats potentially occurring in the 
project area was obtained from the USFWS (USFWS 2011b) and WDFW PHS (WDFW 2010). 
No wildlife species federally listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA are documented 
in the project vicinity (WDFW 2010, USFWS 2011b). This includes no documented occurrence 
of the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) or marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus 
marmoratus) in the project vicinity. No federally listed threatened or endangered species, nor 
suitable habitat, were observed during the site reconnaissance. The project area is maintained as a 
“working forest,” which is currently fragmented and lacks structural complexity and habitat 
elements required for the northern spotted owl and marbled murrelet. 

The WDFW PHS Program data obtained for the project vicinity (T17N, R4W, Section 1 and 
T18N, R4W, Section 36) include 20 occurrences of tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) within 1 mile of 
the project area (WDFW 2010). The tailed frog is a state monitor species and a federal species of 
concern (WDFW 2008, 2010; USFWS 2011b). Survey efforts occurred in 1992, 1998, 1999, 
2002, and 2003. Each occurrence documented 1 to 88 individuals (WDFW 2010). The nearest 
documented occurrence is approximately 4,800 feet downstream of the project area (WDFW 
2010). Tailed frogs live and breed in clear, cold, fast-flowing streams with rock or gravel bottoms 
and are most active in spring and fall (Lawrence et al. 2005). Suitable habitat for this species is 
not present in the project area. 

3.4.1.1 Regulatory Context

Endangered Species Act

The ESA serves as the primary federal protection for species and habitat, by providing a formal 
designation and implementing programs through which the conservation of both populations and 
habitats may be achieved. The USFWS and NMFS are responsible for the administration of the 
ESA. As previously described, DNR manages its forest landscapes, including the Capitol State 
Forest, under the guidance of the State Trust Lands HCP (DNR 1997c). HCPs under section 
10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA provide for partnerships with non-federal parties to conserve the 
ecosystems upon which listed species depend, ultimately contributing to their recovery.
Washington’s State Trust Lands HCP (DNR 1997c) is an ecosystem-based forest management 
plan developed by DNR to provide habitat for species such as the northern spotted owl, marbled 
murrelet, and riparian-dependant species such as salmon (Oncorhynchus sp.) and bull trout 
(Salvelinus confluentus). These species are at some level of risk of extinction — listed as 
threatened or endangered under the ESA. The HCP applies to Washington’s forested State Trust 
lands within the range of the northern spotted owl. The Proposed Action is consistent with the 
strategy, objectives, provisions, and BMPs of the HCP. 

Magnuson Stevens Act – Essential Fish Habitat

The MSA mandates federal agencies that fund activities that may adversely affect the essential 
fish habitat (EFH) of federally managed fish species to consult with NMFS regarding the 
potential adverse effects of their actions on EFH. Three federal fishery management plans and 
their associated EFHs are applicable to projects and activities within Washington state: the 
Pacific coast ground fish fishery, the coastal pelagic species fishery, and the Pacific coast salmon 
fishery. EFH does not occur in the project area, and no indirect effects on EFH are anticipated. 
Therefore, EFH determination for the Proposed Action is “no adverse effect” under MSA, and 
no consultation with NMFS is required. In addition, the DNR HCP (DNR 1997c) satisfies 
consultation requirements of the MSA (USFWS and NMFS 2004).

Migratory Bird Treaty Act

The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) prohibits persons, unless by permit, “to pursue, take, or 
kill…any migratory bird, or any part, nest or egg of any such bird.” Direct and indirect acts are 
prohibited under this definition, although harassment and habitat modification are not included 
unless they result in the direct loss of birds, nests, or eggs. The current list of species protected by 
the MBTA includes all native birds, including many commonly found in western Washington 
forested habitats. DNR would conduct preconstruction surveys for birds, nests, and eggs within 
the construction footprint of the project. If any species covered under the MBTA are nesting 
within the construction footprint, DNR would coordinate with the USFWS and/or WDFW to 
determine appropriate avoidance or minimization measures and ensure compliance with the 
MBTA.

Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act

Administered by the USFWS, this law provides for the protection of the bald eagle (Haliaeetus 
leucocephalus) and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) by prohibiting, except by permit, the 
taking, possession, and commerce of such birds. Golden eagle sightings are relatively rare in 
western Washington. There are no documented occurrences of bald eagles within 1 mile of the 
project area (WDFW 2010). 

3.4.2 METHODOLOGY AND THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE 

The potential effects of the project alternatives on fish and wildlife were evaluated in terms of 
both regulatory considerations and ecological context and intensity. Potential effects were 
determined by gathering and reviewing information regarding fish, wildlife, habitat, and special 
status species, and qualitatively evaluating how the project alternatives could impact fish, 
wildlife, habitat, and special status species based on available literature sources, project details, 
and best professional judgment. Data gathering included a site visit by project ecologists and 
environmental planners to evaluate habitat in the project vicinity. 
A project alternative would reach the significance threshold for effects on fish or wildlife if it 
would:

*	Substantially interfere with the breeding, feeding, or necessary life-cycle movement of 
fish and wildlife.
*	Substantially conflict with any state or local regulations protecting fish, wildlife, or 
habitat.
*	Substantially conflict with the provisions of an applicable species or habitat management 
plan.
*	Result in the long-term degradation of streams or riparian forested habitat in the project 
area or vicinity.

3.4.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

This section describes the potential effects of the project alternatives on fish and wildlife in the 
project area. Measures to avoid, reduce, or mitigate any identified impacts on these resources are 
also identified.

Alternative A (No Action)

Under the No Action Alternative, FEMA would not provide funding for the relocation of the 
Mount Molly Trail as described in Section 2.2 (Alternative A - No Action). Terrestrial and aquatic 
habitat elements important to fish and wildlife would remain unaltered from their current 
condition. There would be no effects on fish and wildlife related to the No Action Alternative.
Alternative B (Proposed Action)
Under the Proposed Action, FEMA would provide funds to DNR for construction of 
approximately 1 mile of new motorized recreation trail, including one bridge, and the 
abandonment and rehabilitation of approximately 0.5 mile of trail, as described in Section 2.3 
(Alternative B - Proposed Action). 

Fish

Because there is no suitable fish habitat in the project area, implementation of the Proposed 
Action would not result in short- or long-term effects on fish.
 
Wildlife

Under the Proposed Action, construction would take place during the drier season, reducing the 
potential effects from run-off and sedimentation during construction. BMPs and a TESC Plan 
would be implemented to prevent run-off and sedimentation from reaching streams and 
downstream aquatic wildlife habitats. Wildlife habitat would be affected by construction-related 
activities such as grading and clearing for the trail and to install a bridge over Potosi Creek. These 
activities are considered a minor short-term and long-term impact on wildlife from a direct loss of 
habitat from construction of 1 mile of new motorized trail (0.5 acre). However, rehabilitation of 
approximately 0.5 mile of trail not damaged in the landslide would provide new wildlife habitat 
in the long term.

Short-term effects on wildlife caused by construction-related activities would result in noise and 
activity from light equipment and construction personnel, as described in Section 2.3, (Alternative 
B - Proposed Action). Noise and other disturbances caused by construction crews may cause 
wildlife to temporarily move away from the construction area. This noise would be in addition to 
baseline noise from recreation activities such as the use of motorized ORVs. Since the habitats 
found in the project area are connected to other similar habitats, many species would temporarily 
relocate in these nearby areas during construction. In the long term, wildlife species would return 
to the area. The construction site for the proposed bridge does not provide habitat for the tailed 
frog. In addition, construction of the bridge would occur during the summer when the project 
area tributary is dry and tailed frogs are not likely to be present in the immediate construction 
zone. Overall, the Proposed Action would have minor short-term impacts from construction and 
minor long-term impacts from permanent loss of wildlife habitat.

Mitigation Measures

The Proposed Action would adhere to BMPs described in the HCP. No additional mitigation 
measures are necessary for fish and wildlife.

Significant Unavoidable Adverse Effects

No significant unavoidable effects on fish or wildlife are anticipated from either of the 
alternatives. 


3.5 RECREATION AND VISUAL RESOURCES

This section describes recreation and visual resources in the project vicinity, and the potential 
effects of the project alternatives on these resources.

3.5.1 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

Recreational Resources

The project is located in the northern half of the Capitol State Forest (Capitol Forest), a 91,650-
acre working forest southwest of Olympia in Thurston and Grays Harbor counties. The Capitol 
Forest is both a timber-producing forest and a popular recreation destination. The forest is 
managed by the DNR Pacific Cascade Region for timber production, wildlife habitat, and 
recreation and public access. Recreation and public access in the forest are managed through the 
region’s Pacific Crest Conservation and Recreation District, in conjunction with the Asset 
Management and Protection Division’s recreation program based in Olympia (DNR 2005).

The Capitol Forest draws an estimated 800,000 visitors each year for hiking, horseback riding, 
camping, mountain biking, ORV use, hunting, nature study, sightseeing, and more. Recreation 
resources within the Capitol Forest are divided into five categories: road use, facilities, trails, 
dispersed use, and organized events. The Capitol Forest contains over 575 miles of roads. Their 
primary use is to facilitate management of the working forest. Public access is considered a 
secondary use. The Capitol Forests contains seven campgrounds, four trailheads, a self-guided 
interpretive area, and a trail system with approximately 160 miles of trail (DNR 2005).

The Capitol Forest’s recreation management emphasis is to provide connectivity throughout the 
landscape via its motorized and non-motorized trail systems. Recreation trails are divided into 
two separate systems – motorized and non-motorized. Motorized recreation trails are located in 
the northern half of the forest (where the project is located), while non-motorized recreation trails 
are located in the southern half of the forest (DNR 2005).

The motorized trail system in the northern half of the Capitol Forest contains 89 miles of 
motorized recreation trails. Most are multi-use trails open to ATVs, motorbikes, mountain bikes, 
and hikers. While soils in the project vicinity are cobbly loam and well drained (NRCS 2009, 
SCS 1990), the clay-based soils inherent throughout much of the Capitol Forest retain water, 
requiring time to dry during the winter season (DNR 2005) (refer to Section 3.1, Geology, Soils, 
and Shoreline Stability for a description of soils in the project vicinity). Since these clay-based 
soils cannot withstand heavy winter trail use, the forest’s trails are closed for most recreation 
users (including motorized recreation) during the winter (from December 1 through April 30). 
Motorized trails are open to motorized recreation from May through November, while mountain 
bikers and hikers may use the trails year round (DNR 2005).

The proposed project trail alignment is a reroute of a portion of the Mount Molly Loop Trail and 
another unnamed motorized recreation trail near Larch Mountain. The Mount Molly Loop Trail is 
7.7 miles long and is open to ATVs, motorbikes, mountain bikes, and hikers (DNR 2005). The 
unnamed trail serves the same uses. These trails are part of a network of connecting motorized 
recreation trails around Larch Mountain. DNR closed the damaged sections of both trails to all 
recreation use following the 2007 landslides due to the unsafe conditions (pers. comm., Wolff 
and Shedd, 2011).

The primary road access to the Larch Mountain area is the C-4000 Road from the Rock Candy 
Trailhead, although the area can be reached using forest roads from other entrances to the Capitol 
Forest as well. The motorized trails around Larch Mountain can be reached from the Rock Candy 
Trailhead (to the north), the Thurston-Grays Harbor ORV Sport Park (to the northwest), the 
Middle Waddell Trailhead (southeast), or the Porter Creek campground area to the west. 

Visual Resources

The landscape surrounding the project site is characterized by open Douglas-fir forest on ridges 
and steep back slopes around Larch Mountain that were last commercially thinned in 1995. 
Forest canopy along the ridge at the project site is broken with views to the west, while views to 
the east are generally blocked by tall Douglas-fir trees. 

Landscape-level views to the west are of the surrounding mountain tops and ridges of the Black 
Hills, including Buck Ridge. These views are generally of a patchwork of commercial forest at 
different stages of maturity, including clearcuts. Landscape-level views to the west also include 
views of the Olympic Mountains beyond. Forest canopy along the proposed trail alignment on 
the back slope is unbroken. While the understory is generally open, site distance is limited to the 
immediate area with no views of the surrounding landscape, except where the proposed project 
alignment crosses the C-4500 Road. Limited views to the east of the Potosi Creek drainage are 
possible from this location.

Site-level views along the proposed trail alignment on the ridge include the C-4500 Road and a 
connecting section of the Mount Molly Porter #3 motorized recreation trail that runs along the 
west slope of Larch Mountain, and surrounding Douglas-fir forest with some open areas along 
the road. Site-level views along the proposed alignment on the back slope are generally of the 
previously thinned, open Douglas-fir forest and low shrub understory described in Section 3.3 
(Vegetation).

3.5.1.1 Regulatory Context

The State Trust Lands Habitat Conservation Plan

DNR manages its forested landscapes, including the Capitol State Forest, under the guidance of 
the HCP, a partnership among NMFS, USFWS, and DNR (DNR 1997c). Under the HCP, 
development of recreation sites must adhere to the riparian conservation strategy (HCP Chapter 
IV.D). Under the HCP, the trail system must be managed adequately to protect wildlife habitats, 
including riparian species. 

The Capitol State Forest Recreation and Public Access Plan

The Capitol State Forest Recreation and Public Access Plan guides DNR in the management of 
public use at recreation sites, on trails, and across the landscapes within the Capitol State Forest 
(DNR 2005). The recreation guidelines within the plan direct ORV use to the northern half of the 
forest and equestrian use to the southern half; allow mountain biking year round throughout the 
entire forest; and restrict certain trail uses to the dry time of the year, among other guidelines.

3.5.2 METHODOLOGY AND THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

The potential effects of the project alternatives on recreation and visual resources were evaluated 
in terms of regulatory and recreation management considerations, context, and intensity. 
AECOM environmental planners gathered and reviewed available information regarding 
recreation resources and activities, and visual resources in the Capitol Forest, and conducted a 
site visit on September 29, 2010 to collect information on general site conditions in the project 
vicinity (along, adjacent, connecting, or visible from the proposed project alignment). Recreation 
and visual resources present in areas that could potentially be affected by the project alternatives 
were identified. Direct impacts of the project alternatives on recreation and visual resources were 
quantified where possible or evaluated qualitatively where quantitative data did not exist or were 
not applicable. Potential indirect impacts of the project alternatives were qualitatively identified 
based on best professional judgment.

A project alternative was determined to have a significant effect on recreation or visual resources 
if it would:

*	Substantially increase safety hazards from conflicts between recreationists and forestry 
activities, or from high ORV speeds.
*	Increase the use of or exceed the capacity of the existing recreational resources such that 
substantial physical deterioration would occur or be accelerated.
*	Substantially affect the quantity or quality of recreational resources, opportunities, or 
activities in the Capitol Forest. 
*	Substantially alter views or the natural visual character of the area.

3.5.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

This section describes the potential effects of the project alternatives on recreational and visual 
resources in the project area. Measures to avoid, reduce, or mitigate for any identified impacts on 
recreational and visual resources are also identified.

Alternative A (No Action)

Recreational Resources

Under the No Action Alternative, FEMA would not provide funds to support DNR in rerouting 
the Mount Molly Loop Trail to bypass above the December 2007 landslides that damaged 
sections of two motorized recreation trails in that area. Without FEMA funding, DNR would not 
construct the proposed trail reroute or rehabilitate the intact sections of trail leading to the 
landslide area. 

Under the No Action Alternative, recreationists would lose the use of approximately 1 mile of 
motorized recreation trail in the Larch Mountain area of the Capitol Forest indefinitely. With 
approximately 89 miles of motorized recreation trail available, this equates to a loss of just over 1 
percent of motorized recreation trail in the Capitol Forest, a minor loss. This would have a minor 
adverse effect on the quantity of recreation resources for motorized recreation in the Capitol 
Forest. It would have a negligible effect on the quantity of recreation resources for non-
motorized recreation as there are at least 160 miles of trail open to non-motorized recreation.

The permanent loss of a 1-mile section of the Mount Molly Loop Trail would force recreationists 
to travel the C-4000 Road for about 1 mile to complete a modified version of the Mount Molly 
Loop Trail route. Recreationists may choose to skip this route altogether, and use of connecting 
trails may increase. This is anticipated to have a minor adverse effect on the quality of the 
recreation experience. It is not likely to increase the use of connecting trails to such a degree that 
it would exceed their capacity to support the use. 

The Capitol Forest is a working forest with ongoing timber harvest activities, including forestry 
vehicles traveling forest roads. It is likely that some recreationists (especially ATV, motorbike, 
and mountain biker users who often travel loop routes multiple times) would travel the C-4000 
Road to complete the Mount Molly Loop because there is no off-road through trail access. This 
would increase potential safety hazards from conflicts between recreationists and forestry 
vehicles. Additionally, according to DNR (pers. comm., Wolff and Shedd, 2011), ORV users 
tend to travel faster on forest roads than on trails, further increasing the potential for conflicts to 
occur. However, it would only be necessary for recreationists to use about 1 mile of the C-4000 
Road, so this is anticipated to have only a moderate adverse effect on recreation.

Overall, the No Action Alternative would have a moderate long-term adverse impact on 
motorized recreation in the Capitol Forest.

Visual Resources

Under the No Action Alternative, no construction activities would take place and no physical 
changes would occur. Therefore, the No Action Alternative would have no effect on site- or 
landscape-level views, and would not change the natural visual character of the area.

Alternative B (Proposed Action)
Recreational Resources
Under the Proposed Action, FEMA would provide funds to support DNR in rerouting the 
Mount Molly Loop Trail to bypass above the December 2007 landslides that damaged sections of 
two motorized recreation trails in that area. Under the Proposed Action, recreationists would 
regain the use of approximately 1 mile of motorized recreation trail in the Larch Mountain area, 
enabling through-access along the Mount Molly Loop Trail and providing them with a safer 
alternative to using the C-4000 Road, reducing potential safety hazards from conflicts with 
forestry vehicles. Overall, this would have a moderate beneficial effect on recreation. 

Visual Resources

Under the Proposed Action, the proposed trail reroute would have a negligible impact on visual 
resources at the site level. The proposed project would have no effect on landscape-level views, 
nor would it alter the natural visual character of the area around Larch Mountain. The proposed 
trail reroute would be visible along the ridge from the C-4000 Road in some locations; however, 
dense, low shrubs would hide most of the trail from view except at close distances. The portion 
of the trail reroute that would switch back down the slope would be more visible from the C-
4000 Road as it would be viewed from above. This would alter the current view; however, given 
that the project site is located in an existing motorized recreation area and in a working forest 
(where roads are common and viewer sensitivity is relatively low), this is considered only a 
negligible adverse effect on visual resources. Rehabilitation of the bypassed trail sections 
damaged in the December 2007 landslides would partially offset this negligible adverse impact 
by restoring the approximately 0.5 mile of motorized recreation trail to more closely resemble the 
surrounding landscape.

Mitigation Measures

No mitigation measures have been identified to offset the moderate long-term adverse impact on 
recreation resources under the No Action Alternative. No mitigation measures have been 
identified to offset the negligible adverse impact on visual resources under the Proposed Action.

Significant Unavoidable Adverse Effects

The project alternatives would have no significant unavoidable adverse impacts on recreation or 
visual resources in the project vicinity. 


3.6 CULTURAL RESOURCES 

This section describes cultural resources in the project vicinity, including historic and 
archaeological resources, the regulatory framework governing cultural resources management, 
and the potential effects of the project alternatives on these resources.

3.6.1 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

Prehistory

The prehistory of the southern Puget Sound region is divided into three periods, Early (8000–
5000 Before Present [B.P.]), Middle (5000–1000 B.P.), and Late (1000–250 B.P.) (Wessen and 
Stilson 1987). Human land use and subsistence/settlement patterns in the southern Puget Sound 
region developed over time from mobile, seasonal foraging of aquatic and nearshore resources in 
the Early Period, to more sedentary winter villages and seasonal camps focused on specialized 
resource exploitation in the Middle to Late Periods. Early Period material culture is dominated by 
stone tool technology; perishable items made of wood and plant fibers are rare to nonexistent in 
all but Late Period sites (Wessen and Stilson 1987). 

Expected archaeological site types and features in the project area might include temporary 
camps established for the collection of waterfowl, small mammals, and fish. Such camps would 
be characterized by hearths, burned bone, fire-affected rock, stone tools and debitage. 

Ethnography

During protohistoric and historic times, the southern Puget Sound region was home to several 
bands of the Nisqually Indians, a Coast Salish language group (Smith 1940; Spier 1936). The 
Nisqually Indians occupied the Nisqually River drainage from its origin at Mount Rainier to the 
mouth of the river northeast of Olympia, as well as the adjacent southern Puget Sound coastal 
area. As with other Salish groups, the Nisqually relied on salmon as a staple resource, 
supplemented by other aquatic resources, terrestrial fauna (deer, waterfowl, and small mammals) 
and plant resources, including roots, nuts, and berries. Nisqually economic and social life focused 
on permanent (winter) villages along rivers and tributaries. In warmer months, family groups 
traveled to temporary camps along the prairie margins and elsewhere to harvest specific 
resources. In late summer and fall, food resources were harvested and processed for winter 
storage. 

Nearby, the Upper Chehalis occupied the inland areas to the south, including Douglas-fir and 
prairie land, which was maintained by annual burning (Hajda 1990; Spier 1936). Salmon played a 
major role in subsistence and were acquired by the Upper Chehalis from the Chehalis River and 
its tributaries. In the winter months, gable-roofed houses were constructed of cedar, and usually 
housed 8 to 12 families (Adamson 1927; Hajda 1990).

History
European settlement of Puget Sound began when Hudson’s Bay Company established Fort 
Nisqually in 1833, which became the hub of fur-trading activity on the sound. By the time Great 
Britain relinquished control of the region to the United States in the 1840s, nearly 4,000 
Americans had settled in lower Puget Sound

In 1854, the Medicine Creek Treaty between the U.S. government and representatives of the 
Nisqually, as well as those of the Puyallup and Squaxin Island peoples, was signed in exchange 
for 2.5 million acres of traditional lands in western Washington. The Nisqually Reservation was 
established in 1854, after which American settlers began to settle and farm the prairie lands the 
Nisqually once occupied. 

The Capitol State Forest is part of trust lands either granted by Congress when Washington 
became a state in 1889, or acquired later as Forest Board trust lands. Capitol State Forest was 
opened to the public in 1955, and state law passed in 1971 allowed for multiple use, including 
hiking, hunting, ATV riding, camping, horseback riding, and fishing. 

3.6.1.1 Regulatory Context

Federal Requirements

National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA)

Section 106 of the NHPA requires federal agencies to take into account the effects of their 
undertakings on properties on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), 
and afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) a reasonable opportunity to 
comment. The historic preservation review process mandated by Section 106 is outlined in 
regulations (36 CFR 800) issued by ACHP.

FEMA Region X has in place a Programmatic Agreement with the Washington State Department 
of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (DAHP) and the EMD to streamline Section 106 
review for FEMA-assisted actions within the state (FEMA et al. 2007, 2011). FEMA is 
consulting with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) within DAHP in accordance with 
the process and timeline in the Programmatic Agreement. FEMA received concurrence from the 
DAHP (on behalf of the SHPO) with its finding in a letter dated June 27, 2011 (Appendix A). 
FEMA is also consulting under Section 106 with Tribes (Nisqually, Skokomish, Quinault, 
Squaxin Island, Chehalis, and Shoalwater Bay) for whom religious and cultural properties on or 
eligible for the NRHP may be affected by the project.

State Requirements

Indian Graves and Records (RCW 27.44)

The Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 27.44 protects Native American graves, cairns, and 
glyptic markings by imposing criminal and civil fines and penalties for disturbing these sites, as 
well as the possession and sale of artifacts.

Abandoned and Historic Cemeteries and Historic Graves Act (RCW 68.60)
This act protects cemeteries and historic graves from mutilation, injury, destruction, or removal. 
Deliberate desecration of these cultural resources is a Class C felony.

3.6.2 METHODOLOGY AND THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Review of literature and records, as well as a predictive model for archaeological resources 
potential, was completed. The statewide predictive model (the Washington Information System 
for Architectural and Archaeological Records Data [WISAARD], developed by the DAHP) is 
based on statewide information, using large-scale factors. Information on geology, soils, site 
types, landforms, and General Land Office (GLO) maps was used to establish or predict 
probabilities for prehistoric cultural resources throughout the state. 

A project alternative would reach the significance threshold if it would diminish or destroy the 
integrity of a property that is on or eligible for the NRHP, for which effects cannot be resolved 
or mitigated.

When there are no historic properties present, or the action will have no impact on historic 
properties, the action is considered to have no effect.

3.6.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

This section describes the potential effects of the project alternatives (A and B) on cultural 
resources.

Alternative A (No Action)

Under Alternative A, FEMA would not provide funds to DNR, and no ground-disturbing 
activities would take place. As a result, Alternative A would result in no effect on cultural 
resources.

Alternative B (Proposed Action)

Under the Proposed Action, FEMA would provide funds to DNR to construct a section of 
motorized recreation trail to bypass the landslide area and C-4500 Road and trail sections, as well 
as construct new trail, build a bridge, and rehabilitate an abandoned portion of trail. 
Approximately 1 mile of trail no more than 6 feet wide would be cleared, removing surface soil 
down to mineral soils. This action has the potential to disturb unknown cultural resources. 

Since there are no recorded cultural resources within the vicinity of the project area of potential 
effects (APE), and the DAHP predictive model and online database reviews show a low 
potential for archaeological sites within the APE, FEMA has made a determination of No 
Historic Properties Affected. This information was provided in consultation letters with the 
SHPO and the Tribes listed above. 

If any unanticipated cultural resources are found during construction, all work would cease and 
appropriate actions would be taken, following inadvertent discovery protocols.

Mitigation Measures

The No Action and Proposed Action alternatives would have no effect on cultural resources. As 
a result, no mitigation measures are necessary. As noted above, if unanticipated cultural resources 
are uncovered during project construction, all work would cease and appropriate actions would 
be taken.

Significant Unavoidable Adverse Effects

No historically significant cultural resources were located in within the project APE. As a result, 
the No Action and Proposed Action alternatives would have no effect on historically significant 
cultural resources.


3.7 ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE 

Environmental justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement in the development and 
implementation of environmental laws, regulations, and policies, of all people regardless of race, 
color, national origin, or income. 

3.7.1 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT

As previously described in Section 3.5 (Recreation and Visual Resources), the project area is in 
Capitol State Forest, which is public land managed by DNR, and a popular place for a variety of 
recreation opportunities (e.g., camping, hiking, hunting, equestrian use, mountain biking, and 
ORV use). Open to the public since 1955, the Capitol Forest primarily serves the surrounding 
areas of Thurston County. Therefore, the affected area is defined as the population of Thurston 
County for the purpose of determining the existence of a low-income and/or minority population. 
Statistics for the state of Washington are also provided for comparison and context. Table 3.7-1 
presents the race and ethnicity of Thurston County and Washington state residents as reported by 
the U.S. Census of Population and Housing using 2009 data (U.S. Census Bureau 2011).

Table 3.7-1. Race/Ethnicity in Thurston County and Washington State, 2009.
[insert table summarinzg U.S. Census Bureau 2011 data].

Low-income households are defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as those households with 
incomes at or below 80 percent of area median household income. For 2008 (the most recent year 
for which data are available), the median household income in Thurston County was estimated at 
$62,146; for Washington as a whole, it was $58,081 (U.S. Census Bureau 2011). Approximately 
9.7 percent of the Thurston County population lived below the poverty threshold, compared to 
11.3 percent of the population of Washington as a whole.

3.7.1.1 Regulatory Context

EO 12898 (Environmental Justice, 59 Federal Register [FR] 7629) requires federal agencies to 
achieve environmental justice by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and adverse 
human health or environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority and 
low-income populations. Potential effects are evaluated by examining the demographics of the 
area affected by the proposed action(s) and the potential of those actions to have 
disproportionately high and adverse effects on minority and low-income populations. 

3.7.2 METHODOLOGY AND THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Environmental justice effects were determined using the EPA’s guidance for federal agencies to 
identify disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority 
populations and low-income populations (EPA 1998). According to these guidelines, a minority 
population refers to a minority group that has a population of greater than 50 percent of the 
affected area's general population (EPA 1998). Although not specifically stated in EPA’s 
guidance, the same rule is used for low-income populations; a low-income population exists if 
there is a community whose general population comprises 50 percent or more people living under 
the threshold for low income. A project alternative would reach the significance threshold for 
environmental justice if it would:

*	Have disproportionately high and adverse environmental or health impacts on low-
income or minority populations.

3.7.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

Alternative A (No Action)

The general population of the affected area (Thurston County) does not include minority or low-
income populations as defined under EPA’s environmental justice guidance (EPA 1998). 
Therefore, the effects on these populations are not disproportionately high, and the No Action 
Alternative would have no environmental justice effects.

Alternative B (Proposed Action)

The general population of the affected area (Thurston County) does not include minority or low-
income populations as defined under EPA’s environmental justice guidance (EPA 1998). 
Therefore, the effects on these populations are not disproportionately high, and the Proposed 
Action would have no environmental justice effects.

Mitigation Measures

The project would have no environmental justice effects, and no mitigation measures are 
necessary.

Significant Unavoidable Adverse Effects

The project would have no significant unavoidable adverse environmental justice effects. 


3.8 CLIMATE CHANGE

The CEQ has issued a draft NEPA guidance document encouraging federal agencies to improve 
their consideration of the effects on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change in their 
evaluations of proposals subject to NEPA documentation (CEQ 2010). Governor Gregoire 
committed Washington state to prepare for and adapt to the impacts of climate change as part of 
Executive Order 07-02. A new focus sheet entitled “Preparing for Impacts” is available from 
Ecology’s website (Ecology 2008b). 

Although the cause of the December 2007 disaster cannot be attributed to climate change, 
changes in precipitation patterns and volatility in precipitation-driven systems, such as the Potosi 
Creek drainage, cannot be ruled out for potential damage in the future due to events associated 
with climate change. This alternate project (the Proposed Action), which would relocate a section 
of the Mount Molly Loop Trail to a location higher in the drainage where it would partially 
follow a ridgeline then switch back down the east slope of the ridge following relatively flat to 
low-gradient (0–5 percent) natural benches for most of the route, would substantially reduce the 
potential future threat of damage to the motorized recreation trail due to events brought on by 
climate change.

Construction and maintenance of the project would result in emissions from equipment operation 
and worker transportation that would negligibly increase short-term greenhouse gas emissions.
Rerouting the trail would not increase total vehicle trips on forest access roads or increase 
motorized recreation to a measurable degree within the motorized trail system of the Capitol 
Forest. 

No mitigation measures are proposed for the project alternatives related to climate change 
impacts.


3.9 CUMULATIVE EFFECTS 

Cumulative effects are those that result from the incremental effect of a Proposed Action when 
added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions, regardless of what 
agency or person undertakes such other action (40 CFR 1508.7). The study area for the analysis 
of cumulative effects in this EA is the Potosi Creek drainage. Past, present, and future actions in 
the Potosi Creek drainage include DNR road and trail construction and maintenance activities, 
timber harvest activities, and recreation use. These types of activities would typically have 
varying levels of effects on vegetation, soils and slope stability, hydrology, water quality, fish 
and wildlife, and visual resources due to vegetation removal and soil disturbing activities. The 
Proposed Action would contribute negligibly to these effects.



4.0 Consultation & Coordination

4.1 PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT

FEMA sent a scoping letter to agencies, Tribes, and local interested parties on March 4, 2011. 
The letter described the proposed project and requested comments on issues and concerns, the 
range of alternatives, and potential effects regarding the project. The scoping letter and the 
comments received are included in Appendix A. These comments were considered and 
addressed in the preparation of this Draft EA. 

4.1.1 COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT EA

The Draft EA will be released for public review. Copies will be sent directly to those agencies, 
Tribes, and stakeholders that participated in scoping and are listed in Chapter 6, Distribution. A 
public notice announcing its availability to the general public for comment will be posted on 
DNR’s website and at the Rock Candy Mountain Trailhead in the Capitol Forest, and the Draft 
EA will be available for viewing at a library or other location accessible to the public in the local 
community. The Public Notice and Draft EA will be posted to the FEMA website, the web 
address of which will be included in the Public Notice.
There will be a 30-day comment period on the Draft EA. Comments from this public review will 
be reviewed and analyzed, and the document revised as appropriate. A Final EA, and a decision 
as to whether a FONSI or an EIS notice of intent is required, will be provided on the FEMA 
website.

4.2 AGENCIES AND TRIBES

FEMA is consulting with federal agencies, Tribes, and local agencies and stakeholders 
throughout the EA process to gather valuable input and to meet regulatory requirements. This 
coordination was integrated with the analysis of project effects and the public involvement 
process.

Because no species are present that are federally listed as threatened or endangered under the 
ESA, no consultation with the USFWS or NMFS is required. Because no EFH is present under 
the MSA, no consultation with NMFS is required for that purpose either.
FEMA is consulting with the SHPO, the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation, and 
with the Nisqually, Skokomish, Quinault, Squaxin Island, Chehalis, and Shoalwater Bay Tribes, 
requesting help in identifying traditional cultural properties that may be affected by the project.
